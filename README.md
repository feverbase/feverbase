# Feverbase
An open platform to accelerate research related to repurposed drugs for fighting COVID-19.

### Code layout

There are two large parts of the code:

**Indexing code**. Uses Arxiv API to download the most recent papers in any categories you like, and then downloads all papers, extracts all text, creates tfidf vectors based on the content of each paper. This code is therefore concerned with the backend scraping and computation: building up a database of arxiv papers, calculating content vectors, creating thumbnails, computing SVMs for people, etc.

**User interface**. Then there is a web server (based on Flask/Tornado/sqlite) that allows searching through the database and filtering papers by similarity, etc.

### Dependencies

Several: You will need numpy, feedparser (to process xml files), scikit learn (for tfidf vectorizer, training of SVM), flask (for serving the results), flask_limiter, and tornado (if you want to run the flask server in production). Also dateutil, and scipy. And sqlite3 for database (accounts, library support, etc.). Most of these are easy to get through `pip`, e.g.:

```bash
$ virtualenv env                # optional: use virtualenv
$ source env/bin/activate       # optional: use virtualenv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) and [pdftotext](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/), which you can install on Ubuntu as `sudo apt-get install imagemagick poppler-utils`. Bleh, that's a lot of dependencies isn't it.

### Running online

If you'd like to run the flask server online (e.g. AWS) run it as `python serve.py --prod`.

You also want to create a `secret_key.txt` file and fill it with random text (see top of `serve.py`).
