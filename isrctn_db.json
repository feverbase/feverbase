                "background_study_aims": "Some patients with Influenza (‘flu’) develop severe infection requiring admission to intensive care. Recent research suggests that patients with severe influenza may be susceptible to a second infection with a type of fungus called Aspergillus. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) carries high mortality but there are potentially life-saving treatments. Unfortunately, IA may currently be under-diagnosed in patients with influenza. This study will take place across four hospitals trusts during the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 influenza seasons. The main aim of the study is to assess what proportion of critically ill patients with severe influenza develop IA, and what factors increase the risk of this happening. The researchers will also look at whether those that do develop IA are more likely to have a prolonged ICU admission or die. This study could help to raise awareness of the potentially high incidence of IA in patients with severe influenza supporting the development of guidance ensuring that appropriate diagnostics are performed in these patients.In 2020 a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in China. This coronavirus was later named ‘SARS-CoV-2’, and the disease it causes ‘COVID-19’. It is not yet known whether patients with severe COVID-19 infection are also at risk of IA. It may be that there is something special about the flu virus that predisposes people, or it could be that anyone with a severe respiratory viral infection is at risk. Comparing the rates of IA between patients with severe flu and COVID-19 infection could help answer this question.Bronchoscopy is a procedure whereby a small camera is used to look inside the lungs. Fluid can then be squirted and re-collected to diagnose the cause of the infection (a bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL). Tests performed on BAL fluid can help diagnose IA but are not available at all hospitals. This study will store surplus BAL samples from patients, and later use them to evaluate a new test called the Aspergillus Lateral Flow Device. Surplus BAL, and blood samples from patients will also be stored and used at a later date to study why patients with influenza develop IA.",

                "study_involves": "This is an observational study which means that the care and treatments patients receive will not be any different whether they decide to take part or not. A single set of research blood tests will be taken once patients are enrolled into the study. If the clinical team feel a bronchoscopy is indicated as part of routine clinical care the study group will take a sample of surplus bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and/or store any leftover samples. A bronchoscopy will not be performed or delayed for the purpose of this study. After the flu season is over these stored blood and BAL samples will be tested using both galactomannan and the AspLFD to compare how well both tests perform in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis. Since this will occur after the flu season the results of this testing will not influence the treatment of those enrolled. In addition to the samples that will be taken and stored, the researchers will collect clinical information from the participants' medical notes until their discharge from hospital or 90 days, whichever is the latest.",
                "benefits_risks": "As an observational study, the only way participants will be directly affected by this research study is the extra blood and BAL samples taken. It is therefore not expected that any patients will come to harm. Patients are also unlikely to directly benefit from taking part in this research either. It is important to realize that any extra testing performed on samples (such as with the AspLFD) will be done at a much later date in the Spring/Summer.",

Leftover serum will also be stored.Data CollectionClinical data will be collected from the electronic hospital records at baseline, during the patient’s ICU stay, and after ICU discharge - up to 90 days or hospital discharge (whichever is longer).Data AnalysisThe researchers will use the collected clinical and microbiological data and BAL/blood galactomannan results to determine the primary and secondary outcome measures, with input from the study statistician for the multivariable analyses.Retrospective Diagnostic EvaluationOnce the prospective study is complete, stored BAL/blood samples will be tested retrospectively in parallel by two tests: galactomannan EIA (the current ‘gold standard’ biomarker test for IA) and by the AspLFD (the new test we wish to validate). This will be done after the influenza season so results will have no implications for participants. The BAL/blood AspLFD results will be compared against the IA status of the patient to evaluate test performance against the AspICU definition.Planned Sub-studiesThese will be subject to further funding and are laboratory studies to help us understand why certain patients with influenza might be at greater risk of developing IA. This will involve measuring levels of immune system cells and immune parameters known as cytokines to look at how influenza affects the immune. The researchers will also use stored DNA to look at specific immune genes that might play a role.",

                "background_study_aims": "COVID-19 is a condition caused by the coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in late 2019. This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe. In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus. Groups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus.There are currently no available vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. Although there have been some suggestions for untested treatments that could be added to the usual care in hospitals, none is known to help. The World Health Organization (WHO) is, therefore, organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other, to discover whether any do help. The study treatments are remdesivir, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir, and interferon-beta. Some are given as daily pills, and some as daily injections.",

During the study, some treatments may get removed from this list, and others may be added to it. Each patient will only receive one of the treatments.The patients will be followed up for the entire length of their hospital stay. Death from any cause will be recorded and this will be the main result used to determine whether a drug is effective. Length of hospital stay and time to first receiving ventilation (or intensive care) will also be recorded and used to determine the drug's effectiveness.",
                "benefits_risks": "All of the drugs tested in this study are used routinely to treat other conditions and have been shown to be reasonably safe. All participants will receive the usual care for people with COVID-19 in each location as well as the study drug. There are known side effects to each of the study medications. It is possible that unexpected serious side effects may occur as with any clinical trial of medicines. It is also possible that treatment with one or more of the test drugs worsens COVID-19 and increases the risk of severe illness or death.It is possible that one or more of the drugs may reduce the severity of COVID-19, reduce need for ventilation, and reduce the risk of death.",

Over time, the virus causes the liver to become irreversibly scarred (cirrhosis), eventually leading to liver failure. Traditional treatments for HCV involved long-term (6-12 months) treatment with drugs called interferons, which often caused severe side-effects. Newer treatments for HCV however can be taken for shorter periods of time, with much less severe side-effects. Almost all people are cured with 12 weeks of treatment, however it is not known what the minimum length of time treatment needs to be taken for to achieve a cure. The aim of this study is to establish what the minimum duration of treatment required is to a have a high chance of curing patients with HCV.",

The second group receive a fixed treatment course of 8 weeks regardless of the amount of virus in their blood.  Within each group, participants are also randomly allocated to either take ribavirin or not twice a day (the dosage is dependent on the participant’s weight). Participants attend study visits on day 3, 7, 14 and 28 after randomisation, every other week until 4 weeks after the end of the (first-line) treatment, 4 weekly until 12 weeks after the end of treatment, and then 24 weeks after end of treatment. At each visit a blood sample is taken in order to test for the levels of the HCV virus in order to see if they are cured. In addition participants are assessed by the clinic team and blood tests will be taken for standard safety tests. If the first line treatment is found to have failed at any time after 4 weeks of treatment, participants stop first line therapy and are treated with a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/ledispavir (Harvoni) once a day and ribavirin twice daily for 12 weeks. This is called the retreatment phase. For retreatment, participants attend on the day of retreatment, on week 2 and 4 of treatment, and then every 4 weeks until 24 weeks after the end of treatment. At each retreatment visit a blood sample is taken in order to test for the levels of the HCV virus, in addition participants are assessed by the clinic team and blood tests are taken for standard safety tests.",

                "background_study_aims": "COVID-19 is a condition caused by a coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in late 2019. This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.  In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus.  COVID-19 disproportionately affects people aged over 50 years with other illnesses and those over 65 years old. The infection causes considerable illness and the risk of death in this population group in particular and is having a devastating effect on people's health and society internationally. So far, there are no proven COVID-19 specific treatments. Most cases are being managed in the community. It is essential to identify treatments that reduce the severity of the infection. An ideal treatment would one that is safe, with few side effects, helps prevent disease worsening, and can be given in the community using existing NHS processes and capability. This study will, in the first instance, evaluate a drug called hydroxychloroquine. This is a drug that is already available within the NHS but that has not been tested for this disease in Europe or in community healthcare settings with the aim of reducing the need for hospital assessment. ",
                "who_can_participate": "Patients with symptoms of possible COVID-19 (continuous cough and/or high temperature) that started within the last 7 days, either aged 65 and over, or aged 50 and over with the following listed illnesses: known weakened immune system due to serious illness or infection (e.g. chemotherapy), known heart disease, known asthma or lung disease, known diabetes not treated with insulin, known mild hepatic impairment, or known stroke or neurological problem.",
                "study_involves": "Participants are randomly allocated to undergo standard care or hydroxychloroquine drug treatment plus standard care. The study drug is hydroxychloroquine sulphate 200 mg tablets. The tablets are for oral use, one tablet (200 mg) taken twice daily for 7 days by mouth (14 tablets in total). This is the standard dose for its normal use in adults. Each dose should be taken with a meal or glass of milk. Antacids may reduce the absorption of hydroxychloroquine so it is advised that a 4-hour interval be observed between taking hydroxychloroquine and an antacid.",
                "benefits_risks": "By taking part in this study, participants will be contributing towards the understanding of how doctors can treat COVID-19 and how the symptoms progress. This may help to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms when people fall ill and reduce the burden on the NHS during this crisis. All participants will also receive a swab, and will be told if the swab is positive or not for COVID-19. With any medicine, including ones that are already used within the NHS, there is a risk of side effects. For the treatment in this study the common side effects include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, headache, nausea, skin reactions, vision changes, and vomiting. Participants will be able to report whether they are experiencing any of these symptoms in the daily diary.",

The trial will be implemented in the first instance in practices that are already part of the RCGP RSC Network. Currently, over 500 practices are part of this network, with 100 already offering a sentinel viral swabbing service which is being scaled up and due to the pandemic, all practices in the UK have been asked to join the RCGP RSC Network.A platform trial, in contrast to say a  traditional two-arm design, allows multiple arms to be considered simultaneously, and interventions can be dropped and replaced as evidence emerges for effectiveness or lack of it. The intent is to establish an on-going trial infrastructure within a master protocol that uses all the data already accumulated for the assessment of current and subsequently introduced interventions. New interventions will only be added after submission to the appropriate approval bodies.The PRINCIPLE trial will begin as a 1:1 randomised trial of usual care plus study-specific medication (in the first instance hydroxychloroquine) versus usual care alone but the study design has the capability to add additional interventions over time. The evaluation of any new interventions will be governed by the master protocol, including adaptive and decision criteria. In addition, the inclusion of any new interventions will require supplementary appendices to the protocol and SAP.  The initial drug is hydroxychloroquine sulphate 200 mg tablets. The tablets are for oral administration. One tablet (200 mg) hydroxychloroquine to be taken twice daily for 7 days by mouth (14 tablets in total). This is the standard therapeutic dose for its normal indication in adults which is for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatological conditions caused or aggravated by sunlight. The Marketing Authorisation holder is Zentiva Pharma UK Limited, Guildford, Surrey, GU1 4YS, UK. Marketing authorisation number is PL 17780/0748.Special instructions: Each dose should be taken with a meal or glass of milkAntacids may reduce the absorption of hydroxychloroquine so it is advised that a 4-hour interval be observed between taking hydroxychloroquine and an antacidComparator is usual care.",

The study will enrol patients who have received an adequate trial of disease-modifying therapies but continued to relapse while being treated, and who meet a minimum severity of disease as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients will have monthly laboratory tests and comprehensive testing every 3 months. Every patient will receive active treatment; there is no placebo. The 24 mg alemtuzumab dose is closed to enrolment so newly enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with either 12 mg alemtuzumab or Rebif® at a 2:1 ratio (i.e., 2 given 12 mg alemtuzumab for every 1 given Rebif®). Alemtuzumab will be administered in two annual cycles, once at the beginning of the study and again 1 year later. Rebif® will be self-injected 3 times per week for 2 years. All patients will be required to return to their study site every 3 months for neurological assessment. In addition, safety-related laboratory tests will be performed at least monthly. Participation in this study will end 2 years after the start of treatment for each patient. Additionally, all patients who receive alemtuzumab will be followed in an extension study for safety and efficacy assessments. Patients who receive Rebif® and complete 2 years on study may be eligible to receive alemtuzumab in an extension study.Initial information at time of registration:The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of two different doses of alemtuzumab as a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), in comparison with Rebif® (interferon beta-1a).

                "background_study_aims": "COVID-19 is caused by a virus that infects the respiratory tract of people and makes them unwell. It started in a city in China and has now spread to several other countries around the world, including the United Kingdom. There is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 at the moment and governments are trying hard to stop it from spreading by making sure that infected people are identified as soon as possible and kept away from others. To know who has the infection you need to do a test and at the moment this is done in large laboratories within hospitals. Although laboratory testing is accurate, it takes a long time to get results back, leading to long delays in identifying positive cases and in identifying patients who are negative. Companies have developed tests for COVID-19 that can be performed outside of the laboratory and take just one hour to give a result. Having a rapid test result may allow doctors to identify infected patients much more rapidly and to stop the virus from spreading in hospitals. It may also identify those who are not infected much earlier allowing them to be taken out of isolation rooms earlier and sent home quickly, easing pressure on the NHS. Previous studies showed that rapidly testing for viruses close to the patient, rather than in laboratories, leads to improvement in patient care. The aim of this study is to find out whether using a new rapid test for COVID-19 performed near the patient leads to earlier decision making and better care for patients.",

                "background_study_aims": "Behçet’s disease (BD) is a rate and poorly understood condition that causes inflammation (swelling) throughout the body. The inflammation associate with BD can cause a wide range of symptoms, including genital and mouth ulcers, eye problems (which can lead to blindness), skin rashes and inflammation of the blood vessels, which increases a person’s risk of developing blood clots and stroke. The exact cause of BD is unknown however many believe it is an autoimmune disorder (in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own, healthy tissue). Traditional treatments include corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medicine) and immunosuppressant drugs (medications that reduce the activity of the immune system), but they can have unpleasant side effects. Biologic therapies are a newer type of medication, which target the biological processes involved in the process of inflammation more selectively. Recently, the biologic drugs infliximab and interferon alpha (aIFN) have been used successfully in treating BD however they are expensive (£16,000/year and £4,000/year, respectively), not always effective and there have been very few studies looking at their effectiveness. The Department of Health has recently commissioned three national Centres of Excellence for BD in London, Birmingham and Liverpool, with the remit to deliver care for the approximate 500 UK patients currently with this condition. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of infliximab with aIFN at treating patients with BD.",

Those in the second group are treated with aIRN. This is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) starting at a dose of 3 million units one a day for 3 days, then 6 million units (for men who weight more than 80kg) or 4.5 million units (for women or men weighing less than 80kg) every day. This dose can be reduced down every 2-4 weeks if necessary to 3 million units twice a week over the course of the study. After 3 and 6 months of treatment, participants in both groups are assessed in order to find out if there has been any improvement to their condition.",

(See screening procedure for details on biopsy requirements) 2. Refractory to, or relapsed following, first-line or second-line treatments with rituximab concurrently with anthracycline or anthracenedione-based chemotherapy (etoposide or gemcitabine allowed if comorbid). Patients who have received further lines of treatment may be included. Refractory disease must fulfil one of the following:2.1 Continuing partial response (PR) from termination of first-line treatment. It is strongly recommended the lymphoma be reconfirmed by biopsy however, if these procedures are deemed to be inappropriate, the CI may determine eligibility following review of the imaging results and disease history.2.2 Continuing stable disease (SD) from termination of first-line treatment. Reconfirmation of the lymphoma by biopsy (preferred) is recommended but not mandatory.2.3 Progressive disease (PD). Biopsy or reconfirmation of the lymphoma is recommended but not mandatory.3.

                "background_study_aims": "Hand osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 2 million people in the UK, causing pain and functional difficulties for many. Painful hand OA affects 8% of women and 3% of men over the age of 45 years. Currently there is no cure. There are few evidence-based interventions other than pain relief and exercise, which are often inadequate. Around 90% of those seeking specialist care for symptomatic hand OA are female. Hand OA is more common in women, especially around the time of menopause, when levels of the hormone estrogen fall. Estrogen-containing therapy appears to protect from progression of knee and hip OA. However, to date there have been no randomised trials testing estrogen-containing therapy in individuals with symptomatic hand OA. The study aims to find out whether it is acceptable to women with painful hand OA to take this type of treatment, and what is the best way of collecting some of the information in order to facilitate planning a full size trial. The long-term aim is to find out whether giving estrogen-containing therapy to women after the menopause improves hand OA symptoms. ",

Measurements of hand pain, function, quality of life and menopause symptoms are collected and the acceptability of taking the drug everyday is assessed. The study involves five study visits and one telephone call over a 7-month period. In addition, some participants are invited to an optional focus group. ",

During the study participants will be monitored closely by a consultant who is an expert in osteoarthritis. Sometimes, conditions are detected that would otherwise have been undetected, for example high blood pressure. In this situation, the study team will give the participant advice on treatment. Joining the study can therefore have indirect health benefits. The study will give us useful information which may be of benefit to others in the future and help the development of new treatments for OA. Participants may experience side effects as a result from taking the study medication. Some participants may have minor bruising because of the needle puncture required for blood testing. ",

Estrogens and SERMs are both likely to have beneficial effects on OA. In hand OA, which appears more closely related to estrogen deficiency, this effect may be greater and more discernible. The individual components, estrogen and bazedoxifene (SERM), cannot easily be tested in view of safety/tolerability considerations. The use of this estrogen-SERM combination may not only be more acceptable but also more effective than either treatment alone. The researchers need to test the hypothesis that a trial of this therapy in this population is feasible before proceeding to a full trial.",

                "intervention": "The primary research question is whether carrying out a full randomised controlled trial of estrogen-containing therapy in post-menopausal women with symptomatic hand OA is feasible. This is because this is the first time that a study of this nature has been carried out in symptomatic hand OA. Like most interventional trials, the study is proposed because we believe there may be benefit to patients, but we have no direct evidence to support the drug’s routine use for OA in general, or hand OA in particular. There were a number of uncertainties identified at the time of designing the study around the feasibility of recruitment, retention and acceptability to participants, and need for refinement of outcome measures to be used which meant that a feasibility study design was recommended and selected (following Research and Design Service (RDS) RDAP review January–April 2016). The study has been designed to systematically address these feasibility questions. The results of this study will also significantly build on existing knowledge, being the first time that estrogen-containing therapy has been given in a controlled trial setting to those with symptomatic hand OA. As such it will also provide important ‘proof of concept’ data, and estimates of the effect of the study medication (although the study is not designed to definitely detect the presence or absence of an effect).Study populationWe have closely mirrored the inclusion criteria of the previous clinical trials of the combination drug under test, with similar inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding age, time from menopause and other medical contraindications etc. This is to maximise safety in the study, based on previous experience. Several aspects have been discussed with the drug company who were involved in these trials. As the trial does not require the presence of menopausal symptoms, but does require the presence of hand pain secondary to OA, the use of this medication is outside of its existing European license for use. One option was to also require the presence of significant menopausal symptoms such as regular, debilitating flushing in addition (so that the drug would be being used within existing license). However, the study investigators felt that this would make the study unfeasible, as the restrictive criteria would make recruitment too challenging, and did not reflect the primary study question.We do not have sensitive imaging tools for diagnosing hand OA. For this reason, we will include those who fulfil clinical diagnostic criteria without X-ray change. This is to include as many people with painful hand OA as possible. There is good evidence that the clinical diagnostic criteria alone are specific for hand OA, so we feel this is justified. We will still X-ray all those who have not had OA evident on an X-ray in the last 3 years, as many will have supporting X-ray change, which strengthens the diagnosis. This is standard practice in OA clinical trials. Some may also have existing ultrasound which documents the presence of osteophytes, which further supports diagnosis (there is some support for this approach, but no agreed ultrasound diagnostic criteria for OA, hence we will not require this). Sample numberWe will recruit up to 90 participants. This sample size allows us to fully test the rates of recruitment at study sites over a period of time. It has been calculated on feasibility grounds, not on statistical grounds. If numbers of minimum participants recruited which have been pre-specified are not reached as below, we would not pursue proceeding to a full study.Minimum stop-go criteria for a full study:1. Recruitment of ≥30 participants at 2 sites in the defined period2. Drop-out rate of ≤30% of randomised individuals3. Acceptability to the majority of participants including acceptable rates of adverse eventsOur non-essential success criterion is an apparent difference in outcomes between the treatment and placebo.Choice of study agentWe wish to test estrogen-containing therapy. Estrogens cannot be given without combination with other drugs, such as progestins or SERMs, in those with a womb, because of cancer risk. SERMs, as opposed to the usually used progestins, appear to potentially offer additional benefit in pre-clinical models of OA. In selecting an agent to test, we also considered availability and use within the UK, available safety data, acceptability to patients and feasibility of blinded delivery (tablets, versus gel or patch). Duavive was selected as the only available licensed estrogen-containing therapy combined with a SERM in the EU. The administration of a daily tablet to all participants was feasible and acceptable to the patient discussion group. The initial plan and hope was that Pfizer would support a drug only request (through their IIR funding scheme) in which we had advanced to a late stage. This would have provided study medication and identical matching placebo for use in the study. Unfortunately, Pfizer withdrew their support for this request on financial grounds, following the study being funded by NIHR. Therefore, no commercial bodies who could benefit are supporting this study in any way or contributing to the protocol, which avoids a potential conflict of interest. Design of study We will run a miniaturised version of a full randomised controlled trial with the same outcome measures so that we can fully test feasibility and acceptability, and refine how we would carry out a full trial. The data will also enable us to accurately calculate a sample size for a future study. This means including an active and a control arm, with the same anticipated ratio for randomisation (1:1) to assess the acceptability to participants of this approach. This approach was supported by our patient discussion group (April 2016).Placebo control There are two reasons why it is important that we include a placebo arm; 1) In any drug trial measuring pain, there is a placebo response – this is a well-recognised feature of being in a clinical trial and taking a tablet. Pain improves somewhat, even if that tablet is inactive. Without a placebo control arm in a full trial, we would over-estimate the effects of a drug, and we wish this feasibility study to mirror the design of a full study as closely as possible. 2) Because not everyone will receive active medication in this study, this can affect individual decisions to participate or not. Without the chance of placebo more people may choose to participate which could be misleading in regards to feasibility of recruitment. Various strategies to produce an alternative source of matched placebo to the one which would have been provided by Pfizer were examined including over-encapsulation and re-blistering, or synthesis of a close-match placebo, with dispensing of tablets in identical opaque pots. However, because of issues with lack of stability of medication outside of the blister packaging and the costs of stability testing of over-encapsulated drug (which were prohibitive, >£150K), a practical decision was made to provide similar active and placebo medication in blisters. These are placed in identical over-packaging of study medication to maintain blinded participants and investigators. Study procedures will maintain the blind as far as possible. Participants will be asked at the end of the study whether they knew which arm of the study they were in. Given that this is a feasibility study, this approach has been supported as reasonable by our collaborating clinical trials unit (OCTRU) and our Trials Pharmacy. We have also involved Pfizer and the MHRA in discussions around IMP stability in coming to these decisions.The study investigators in consultation with the RDAP review and patient discussion group initially proposed a further, third arm of traditional (estrogen +/- progesterone) HRT, with participants in this arm stratified to this on the presence of absence of a uterus. However, first round peer review by NIHR Research for Patient Benefit (which included multiple scientific and lay reviewers) found this design overly complex for the size and aims of the study, and simplification to a 2 arm approach was encouraged and subsequently supported in the second round application. The active arm (estrogen plus SERM, Duavive) was selected on the basis that it was most likely to give patient benefit, based on existing data. We believe that this simplified 2-arm study is more ethical as it is more achievable and an effect is more likely to be seen. This is balanced against less post-marketing surveillance for Duavive than other forms of HRT.The finalised protocol has since been reviewed by members of the trial steering committee, and our participant information leaflet and consent form have also been reviewed by a lay co-applicant and a patient reviewer. The outcome measures have been reviewed by the patient discussion group, who found them acceptable.Recruitment and Randomisation  A number of standard routes to recruitment will be used such as secondary care clinics, and GP surgeries as PICs. In some cases, the treating physician may be a study investigator. In other cases, identifying physicians may refer individuals with their consent for consideration of the study. At this point, minimal contact details would be passed on. We will ensure that this process is free from undue influence or inducement and make no therapeutic promises (the reason for the study is that there is uncertainty about effect and this is made clear in the participant information leaflet). A computerised randomised system will be used for allocation of participants, to ensure equipoise.Eligibility Criteria Rationale for both inclusion and exclusion criteria have been carefully considered by the investigator team and have scientific and/or medical justification in terms of a) those fulfilling adequate diagnostic criteria for hand OA, without other conditions/medications which would affect the outcome of the study; b) a population with sufficient hand pain to justify their inclusion in a study of this type; and c) a population who may safely be prescribed Duavive/HRT as per SmPC and international guidance. Key criteria have also been considered by a patient discussion group.Inclusion criteria The age and time from menopause, and history of lack of use of other hormonal therapy, are from the SmPC for Duavive and also after review by our gynaecologist co-applicant (little experience in those >65 years would lead to safety concerns). We will perform pregnancy tests in those at any risk of pregnancy at the discretion of the clinician investigator as many participants by definition, will not be at risk of this.Previous:The inclusion of hand OA in this study is restricted to interphalangeal disease (we have no evidence that base of thumb OA would respond in the same way to this therapy, and it has other treatments) and in those with regular pain, and of moderate severity (4/10). This mirrors eligibility criteria for similar previous CTIMPs in hand OA, to ensure that a pain response is detectable if present in a full study.Updated 28/02/2020:The inclusion of hand OA in this study is restricted to those with regular pain, and of moderate severity (4/10). This mirrors eligibility criteria for similar previous CTIMPs in hand OA, to ensure that a pain response is detectable if present in a full study.Exclusion criteria reflect exclusions for HRT use in clinical practice, and for Duavive in particular, and have been informed by the SmPC for the study medication. This is to maximise safety of the study, and test in a similar population to those who would be prescribed Duavive in usual clinical care as far as possible. Exclusions include alternative reasons for hand pain (as this would dilute the findings of the study) and those who would be using treatments which would interfere with the outcome in a full study.It is important to stress that we are not excluding those without a womb, as would have been the case in the HRT trials. This is because we are not giving the SERM purely for womb protection (as it would be in standard HRT use) but because we want to test if the SERM may have some additional clinical benefit. This requires us to test the effect of the combination in all participants, irrespective of presence/absence of a womb. Timetable for the studyThe study lasts for 36 months. The first 6 months will be involved in study set up including HRA approval, manufacture and QP release of placebo, and set up of research sites. The following 24 months will involve study activity, 18 months of active recruitment, and a following 6 months until the last participant’s face-to-face visit.The last 6 months will include focus groups, database clean and lock down, analysis and initial study reporting and publication. There will be no interim analyses. The trial steering committee will meet at planned times during the study to review progress and safety.What is involved for the participant who takes part in the study: There are 5 face-to-face study visits and one remote visit over a 7 month period. The visits will take place in a research outpatient clinic setting in the two hospital sites, and in a clinic room in the primary care site.Those participants that have not had an X-ray in the past 3 years will also be required to go for an X-ray which may be on a different day to the screening visit depending on which site they have been recruited to.Visits will take no longer than 3 hours and often be shorter: Visit 1 - screening (-14 to -42 days before baseline) (3 h), Visit 2 – baseline (2.5 h), Visit 3 – week 4 (1 h), Visit 4 – week 12 (2 h), Visit 5 – week 24 (2 h) and follow-up telephone call - week 28 (30 min).Face-to-face visits are necessary to assess for adverse events, provide new prescriptions and perform blood test monitoring. Self-complete questionnaires will be the main method of assessment. Participants can be seen outside of study visits if medically required. One of the questionnaires does look at the possibility of research bias, in terms of the possibility of inadvertent un-blinding in the study.At Visit 5 - week 24, participants will be advised on how to wean off the study medication over a 4 week period from the day after Visit 5 to the Week 28 telephone call. During the first 2 weeks, the participant should take 1 tablet on alternate days and for the third and fourth weeks, the participant should take 1 tablet on every third day or less before stopping. It is advisable to wean off the study medication gradually like this because it will decrease the chances of the participant experiencing spotting or vaginal bleeding during this time. Some participants will also attend an optional focus group which will occur 1-3 months after the last participant has finished the study. The focus group will be led by an experienced facilitator who is trained on the protocol and who can be unblinded. Two focus groups will be organised, one at the Oxford site and one at the London site. Each focus group will not last longer than 2 h.No participant samples will be kept or stored linked to this consent.Data collection will be primarily via paper Case Report Forms (pCRFs): investigator and participant, for entry into a secure electronic database hosted on a secure University server. For daily rating of average hand pain, 2 different methods of capturing this data remotely will be tested. These will compare the collection of data via either direct entry into the study database accessed via SMS (text) message link to a participant’s phone, or the completion of a paper diary, with a telephone call reminder.Travel expenses incurred for study visit attendance will be refunded.",

Without early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, aimed primarily at preventing the common causes of ill-health and death (which include bacterial diseases and malaria) the disease is associated with high mortality during childhood. Although implementation of early life screening and the prevention of infections with vaccines, penicillin and drugs for malaria, can lead to greatly improved survival, other complications of sickle cell disease can still lead to a reduced quality of life. The overarching aim of this study will be to investigate whether a number of alternative treatments, delivered pragmatically by non-specialist staff in , could improve survival and quality of life for children with sickle cell disease living in resource-poor environments within sub-Saharan Africa.",

The first randomisation will be to hydroxyurea, prescribed pragmatically through a weight-band based dosing strategy aimed at delivering 25 +/-5mg/kg/day, with clinically based monitoring only, versus placebo control. The second and third randomisations will be to standard of care prophylaxis for malaria using suphadoxine-pyramethamine given monthly or alternative prophylaxis with dihydroartemisinin-piperoquine given weekly and standard of care prophylaxis for bacterial infections with penicillin V given twice daily until the age of 5years or alternative prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole given once daily throughout childhood.

                "benefits_risks": "BENEFITSExtra clinical personnel, regular clinical assessment of participants and basic equipment for patient monitoring will be available during the trial so that if SCD complications were to arise they will be detected and treated more often. Pre-trial training will include sign recognition for these complications and training on treatment. Both these will be covered in detail in the trial Manual of Operations (MOP).The direct benefits to the participating centres will include: • Support, capacity development and training in the management of SCD in childhood and the use of hydroxyurea therapy. • Establishing or further developing SCD clinicsBenefits For the health personnel involvedThe direct benefits to health personnel are mainly professional development of the members of the trial teams and clinical teams for the purposes of running the trial – including training in clinical trials, good clinical and laboratory practice and research ethics. However, as above, they will also receive standardised training in the identification and treatment of SCD and relevant adverse eventsBENEFITS TO WIDER SOCIETYWider society will benefit from all of the above factors and the study will also act as a focal point for a greater appreciation and understanding of sickle cell disease within the region.RISKS OF PARTICIPATINGIt is anticipated that all study participants will be at lower risk of morbid and mortal events than they would be if not recruited to the study and that one or more of the interventions will improve their lives even further. We assess the risk benefit ratio to be extremely favourable",

                "intervention": "Sildenafil (Viagra) and similar drugs eg tadalafil are phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor drugs that have been widely used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in humans. One of the possible side effects of sildenafil is changes in vision and previous studies have shown that sildenafil can increase visual time constants ie cause a small increase in the length of time that an image is perceived on the back of the eye (retina). This can lead to symptoms of changes in vision for the patient taking the drug. It has been suggested that the change in vision caused by sildenafil may be due to inhibition of the phosphodiesterase type 6 (PDE6) receptor in the light receptor cells of the eye. Although sildenafil and tadalafil predominantly act to inhibit the PDE5 receptor, sildenafil also has a significant degree of action in inhibiting the PDE6 receptor, whereas tadalafil shows very limited inhibition of this receptor. We hope to establish whether PDE6 inhibition is the mechanism of the increase in visual time constants caused by sildenafil by performing a series of computerised visual tests to measure visual time constants following dosing with single oral doses of sildenafil, tadalafil or placebo. If PDE6 inhibition is the mechanism of the increase in visual time constants, we should observe changes in the visual time constants with sildenafil, but not tadalafil or placebo.12 healthy male volunteers aged 18-55 years will be recruited to take part in this study. Volunteers will attend for a screening visit at which written informed consent will be taken and inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked. A brief medical history will be taken, blood pressure measured and 12-lead electrocardiogram (heart tracing) performed. Vision will be tested to exclude colour blindness and a 20ml sample of venous blood will be taken for DNA analysis to look at differences in the PDE6 gene.",

All of those who have consented to be contacted again will be invited to take part in this follow-on study. The trialists anticipate approximately 50% recruitment which equates to 80 participants. Participants will be contacted and invited to take part in the study and to receive booster doses of Ad26.ZEBOV. However, if they do not wish to receive a booster, they may opt to remain in the study and become part of the \"control\" (unboosted) cohort. These participants will have their immune response to the initial Ebola vaccines followed up with blood tests but will receive no vaccines.Those who express an interest in the study will be provided with an information booklet. If participants are willing to proceed after having read this information they will be invited for their first visit.There will be a total of four visits for those participants who receive a booster dose and two visits for those who do not. All clinical visits will take place either at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Churchill Hospital or at the NIHR/Wellcome Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility, Hammersmith Hospital depending on where the participants  attended their visits during the parent studies.At Visit 1 (V1) the contents of the information booklet will be discussed with a doctor or nurse, including:• the exact nature of and the rationale for performing the study• implications and constraints of the protocol• the risks and benefits involved in taking partThe participant will have ample time to consider whether they wish to take part in the study and to ask questions.If the participant wishes to take part in the study they will be asked to provide written informed consent by personally signing and dating the latest approved version of an informed consent form. This form will also be signed by the study staff member who took part in the informed consent discussion. A copy of the signed informed consent form will be given to the participant and the original will be retained at the study site. Once informed written consent has been obtained, baseline assessments and information collection are carried out by an appropriately trained member of the study team (usually a nurse or doctor) as part of the assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. To summarise, the following will occur at V1 (Day 1: all participants):• The nature of the study will be discussed in detail, including the option of receiving no booster vaccine. Obtain informed consent. • Assess eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria: section 7.2), including re-assessment of criteria submitted on pre-screening questionnaire.• Perform blood draw: 50 ml of blood will be collected at each visit from each participant. The date of sample collection will be recorded in the CRF and the laboratory requisition form.• If the participant has opted to receive the booster vaccine:o Carry out physical examination and record oral temperature, pulse and blood pressureo Perform urine pregnancy test for females o Administer vaccine by IM injectiono Observe for immediate adverse events for 30 minuteso Provide participant with a Medic Alert Contact Card with 24 hour telephone number to reach a study doctor o Remind participants to contact the study team if they have any concerns regarding their wellbeing, symptoms and/or admission to hospital.o Distribute eDiary log in details will be distributed to participants receiving a boost vaccine, along with training on how to complete. Additional paper backup copies of the eDiary will also be provided.• Schedule next visit Participants will be asked if they would consent for their samples to be stored following the end of the study in the Oxford Vaccine Centre BioBank (‘Oxford Vaccine Centre Biobank’ Southampton & South West Hampshire LREC (B) 10/H0504/25). Biobank is a separate study and optional to all participants of studies conducted by OVC. Separate consent is sought for this. Study participants who consent for the Biobank, will have their samples stored according to local SOPs for future research. Added 04/06/2019: Visit 2 (V2) (Day 7: only those who have received booster vaccine)The following will occur at Visit 2:• Review electronic diary entries, any relevant adverse events and use of any concomitant medication since the last visit• Check for serious adverse events• Record oral temperature, pulse and blood pressure• Perform blood draw: 50 ml of blood will be collected. The date of sample collection will be recorded in the CRF and the laboratory requisition form.• Schedule next visit • Remind participants to contact the study team if they have any concerns regarding their wellbeing, symptoms and/or admission to hospitalVisit 3 (V3) (Day 28: only those who have received booster vaccine)The following will occur at Visit 3:• Review electronic diary entries, any relevant adverse events and use of any concomitant medication since the last visit• Check for serious adverse events• Record oral temperature, pulse and blood pressure• Perform blood draw: 50 ml of blood will be collected. The date of sample collection will be recorded in the CRF and the laboratory requisition form.• Schedule next visit • Remind participants to contact the study team if they have any concerns regarding their wellbeing, symptoms and/or admission to hospitalVisit 4 (V4) (Day 365: all participants)The following will occur at Visit 4:• Check for serious adverse events• Perform blood draw: 50 ml of blood will be collected at each visit from each participant. The date of sample collection will be recorded in the CRF and the laboratory requisition form.In the event of an unexpected or serious adverse event, a participant may need to have unscheduled clinic visit at any point during the study. Safety bloods might be sent at these visits, at the discretion of the investigator.When all participants have completed their fourth visit, data cleaning and analysis will commence. When this is complete a publication will be prepared and submitted for publication. Participants will be informed when publication is to take place.",

In the past the standard treatment for many patients with kidney cancer that had spread to other organs was a drug called Interferon. In some patients who were treated with Interferon removing the kidney containing the tumour was shown to improve the length of time patients survived.  New drugs (like Sunitnib) are now available for the treatment of kidney cancer which have been shown to be much more effective than Interferon and we do not know if removing the kidney is still of benefit to patients.  If nephrectomy is no longer needed this would avoid a major operation. The purpose of this study is to see if nephrectomy is of benefit in patients receiving Sunitinib who have a tumour in their kidney with metastasis at the time of diagnosis.",

The retina is a layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye which are responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are carried to the brain, where they are interpreted as the images we see. In CSCR, fluid (which leaks from a layer of tissue underneath the retina called the choroid) builds up under the retina causing vision to become distorted and leading to vision loss in around a third of cases. The exact cause of CSCR is unknown however there does appear to be a genetic link, as it often appears in members of the same family. Currently, there are no proven effective treatments. Recently a few patients have responded to treatment with a drug called eplerenone, which removes the fluid buildup and improves vision. However, information on the long term benefit and safety of this drug is lacking. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of eplerenone in the treatment of CSCR.",

Participants attend study visits at four weeks and then three, six, nine and twelve months. At each visit, participants undergo sight tests, an eye examination, completing a number of questionnaires, as well as having blood samples taken. Participants are also asked for permission to take an additional blood sample at their first visit, so that the genetic material and other components from their blood can be stored for a future study. If the CSCR has resolved at any of these visits, the treatment is stopped (it can be restarted if it reoccurs).",

Treatment will be stopped at week 4, months 3, 6, 9 or 12 if there is complete resolution of sub-retinal fluid (SRF) under the fovea in the study eye. Treatment will be restarted at a subsequent visit if there is recurrence of sub-foveal SRF. The same dose escalation process will apply on restarting treatment.

                "acronym": "",
                "study_hypothesis": "Despite major efforts made by national and international health organisations, malaria remains the most widespread infectious parasitic diseases and one of the most serious global health problems in the world. In sub-Saharan African, the main problem is Plasmodium falciparum drug-resistance, especially with the spread of the parasite resistance to the inexpensive and widely used drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ) or sulphadoxinepyrimethamine (SP), and the major consequence is the use of ineffective antimalarial drugs leading to the increasing malarial incidence and mortality. Therefore, substantial efforts have been made to encourage the monitoring and the evaluation of the antimalarial drugs resistance in the endemic countries for assessing regularly their antimalarial drug policies and ensuring a continued coverage of effective antimalarial treatment. In Madagascar, since 2005, antimalarial treatment is in transition with the elaboration and the implementation of the new national policy for the fight against malaria. The main modifications in term of drugs use has been the withdrawal of CQ in favour of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), as first-line (artesunate plus amodiaquine combination, ASAQ) and second-line treatment (artemether plus lumefantrine combination), and the use of the SP for intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPTp). This choice was guided by the recommendations of World Health Organization (WHO) and unpublished data from a clinical trial conducted on the island of Sainte Marie in 2004, which show 36.9% of treatment failure over the 14-day follow-up period, unadjusted by genotyping. However, with regards to the home treatment of presumed malaria in children (HMM), it has been decided to continue to use pre-packaged chloroquine, either PaluStop® sold by the NGO \"Population Service International\" (PSI) or Ody Tazomoka® freely distributed at primary public health facilities by Malagasy Ministry of Health (Mal-MoH), as transitory measure until ACTs were available at community level. At present, the implementation of the ACTs as first-line treatment at health centres level is complete on the east coast of Madagascar, with the result that only 24% (31/131) of the health districts in Madagascar are using ACT. Since 1999, the antimalarial drug resistance surveillance system in Madagascar is supported by a national network for the surveillance of malaria resistance (named RER - Réseau d'Etude de la Résistance). The RER was formed as a collaborative effort between the MalMoH and the Malaria Research Unit of the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM). The strategy of monitoring was initially based on the use of the in vitro assessment of P. falciparum sensitivity to antimalarial drugs and the evaluation of the frequency of genetic markers associated with P. falciparum drug resistance. In vivo studies were also carried out, but these studies were limited geographically, the sample sizes were small and used only a 14-day follow-up period, a series of constraints which may have significantly underestimated the true risk of treatment failure. No data concerning the susceptibility of P. vivax to SP is available. In order to improve the monitoring of antimalarial drug resistance in Madagascar, a new RER was set up in 2006, with the support of the Global Fund. According to the WHO recommendation, this network was based on sentinel sites located within public or private health facilities and selected to be representative of the range of ecological and epidemiologic conditions. This multi-site randomised clinical trial aims to assess the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial therapies recommended by the National Malaria Control Programme.",

Once written informed consent was given, patients were enrolled in the study and assigned consecutive patient numbers. Randomisation to treatment group was performed in blocks of three or four, and treatment regimens were allocated by an independent individual, not involved in the analysis of the study. Patients were administered either CQ (10 mg/kg on days 0 and 1, and 5 mg/kg on day 2), AQ (10 mg/kg on days 0, 1, and 2), SP (25 mg/kg sulphadoxine and 1.25 mg/kg pyrimethamine as a single dose on day 0) or ASAQ (AS: 4 mg/kg on days 0, 1, and 2 and AQ:10 mg/kg on days 0, 1, and 2). Patients were directly observed for 30 minutes after treatment, and the dose was readministered if vomiting occurred. Patients who repeatedly vomited their first dose of study medication were excluded from the study. Patients were assessed on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28, and any intervening day they were unwell for malaria infection. Blood was obtained by finger prick on all follow-up days and on any unscheduled day to use for analysis of thick and thin blood smears and for storage on filter paper. Thick and thin blood slides were examined by light microscopy for parasites on any day during the 28-day follow-up. Blood slides were read by a microscopist blind to treatment allocation. All slides were controlled by a second microscopist also blind to treatment group and previous diagnosis. Discordant slides were read, blind to treatment group and previous diagnosis, by a third microscopist. Haemoglobin was measured on Day 0 and Day 28 using a HemoCue® haemoglobinometre (HemoCue AB, Sweden).P. vivax clinical trial:All patients included were weighed and their medical histories (including previous antimalarial medication) recorded. Clinical examination, including axillary temperature recording and Giemsa staining of serial thick and thin blood films, was carried out on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Thick and thin films were read by a skilled microscopist. Patients were treated with the standard CQ regimen (25 mg/kg of body weight per day for 3 days) or the standart SP regimen (25 mg/kg sulphadoxine and 1.25 mg/kg pyrimethamine as a single dose on day 0) and monitored for 28 days. Patients were directly observed for 30 min after treatment, and the dose was readministered if vomiting occurred. Patients who repeatedly vomited their first dose of study medication were excluded from the study. Blood was blotted onto filter paper during follow-up and was stored at 4°C for DNA analysis. The haemoglobin concentration was determined on days 0 and 28 (HemoCue AB, Sweden).",

                "background_study_aims": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition in which the heartbeat is irregular. When the heart beats irregularly, blood clots can form within the heart. If a blood clot then breaks off, it can travel along blood vessels to the brain, where it can block a blood vessel and cause a stroke. This type of stroke is called a cardioembolic ischaemic stroke. After a cardioembolic stroke there is a significant risk of a further stroke, and this risk is highest in soon after the stroke. Treatment with blood-thinning drugs called anticoagulants considerably reduces the chance of this. However, we are not sure of the best time to start these anticoagulants after a stroke. On one hand, the sooner an anticoagulant is started, the sooner we can reduce the risk of a further stroke happening by preventing blood clots. On the other hand, there is concern that starting anticoagulation too soon after a stroke could increase the risk of bleeding in the brain, which can be serious and cause symptoms similar to another stroke. At the moment, many doctors delay starting anticoagulants until 7-14 days after stroke. This practice dates back to a time when the only anticoagulant tablet available was warfarin, which has a relatively high risk of causing bleeding. Unfortunately, some patients may have a further stroke while waiting to start an anticoagulant. Now, newer anticoagulant tablets called Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) are available and are very widely used to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. Several large studies have shown that these DOACs have a considerably lower risk of causing bleeding in the brain than warfarin. Because DOACs have a lower risk of causing bleeding, it might be possible to safely start them much sooner after a stroke than the current 7 – 14 days. This may prevent further strokes without causing extra bleeding, and evidence from several small studies supports this. The aim of this study is to compare this new approach (starting a DOAC within 4 days of stroke) to the existing usual treatment (starting a DOAC at 7 to 14 days after stroke). ",
                "who_can_participate": "Patients aged 18 or over admitted to hospital with an ischaemic stroke (a stroke due to a blocked blood vessel in the brain), who have atrial fibrillation and whose doctor recommends starting treatment with a DOAC",
                "study_involves": "After deciding to take part in the study, participants complete questionnaires about their medical background and current health and quality of life. They are then randomly allocated to start treatment with a DOAC early (within 4 days of stroke) or at the standard time of 7-14 days after stroke. The only difference between groups is the time at which the DOAC is started – all other aspects of medical care are the same. Apart from a urine pregnancy test for participants of child-bearing potential, no additional tests are needed as part of the study. Participants are asked to attend one follow-up appointment, 90 days after they join the study. This is usually in person, but can be conducted by phone if needed. Participants are asked to complete questionnaires about their health since joining the study, their medication and healthcare use, and quality of life and ability to perform day-to-day activities.",
                "benefits_risks": "Participants in the early treatment group receive a DOAC earlier than is current standard practice. It is hoped that this will be better than the current standard treatment, preventing recurrent strokes without increasing the risk of bleeding. However, this is not certain, which is why we need to perform the study. It is possible that the opposite is true, and that the study treatment will increase the risk of bleeding and/or be no more effective in preventing further strokes. The researchers will be monitoring this throughout the study, and should any evidence arise that early treatment is worse than standard treatment, they will stop the study early. It cannot be guaranteed that participants will benefit from taking part in the study. However, participants will be followed up by a stroke research team which might improve access to advice and information about stroke care. The information from the study will be used to improve treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation who have a stroke in the future.",

Randomisation will be carried out in sufficient time (ideally, within 72hrs of stroke onset) for participants to receive a DOAC within 96 hours of stroke onset if allocated to the intervention arm. Participants and treating physicians will not be blinded, but outcomes will be assessed blinded to treatment allocation.Participants in the study intervention arm will receive a DOAC within 4 days (96hrs) of stroke onset. Participants in the control arm will receive a DOAC no earlier than day 7 (>144hrs) and no later than day 14 (<336hrs) after stroke onset, timing which reflects standard, guideline-based practice in the United Kingdom. The exact timing of anticoagulation within the specified period is at the discretion of the treating physician, as is the choice of DOAC. Any DOAC regimen licensed for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation may be used, currently:1. Dabigatran; standard dosage 150 mg BD, reduced dosage (if indicated) 110 mg BD2. Apixaban; standard dosage 5 mg BD, reduced dosage (if indicated) 2.5 mg BD3. Edoxaban; standard dosage 60 mg OD, reduced dosage (if indicated) 30 mg OD4. Rivaroxaban; standard dosage 20 mg OD, reduced dosage (if indicated) 15 mg ODThe four DOACs will be used according to their drug licenses in this trial. The choice of DOAC will be decided by the treating doctor, but the timing of treatment will be allocated to either early or standard. It is expected that 3500 adult patients (> = 18 years) admitted to +100 participating acute stroke units with acute ischaemic stroke and AF will be screened for eligibility, and consented (by patient or legal representative if the patient is too unwell to make their own decisions). They will then be entered into the trial receive early or standard DOAC treatment. Patients who cannot have anticoagulant treatment because of specific conditions such as an increased tendency to bleed or poor liver function will be excluded. Participants will be followed up at 90 days post-study entry to collect information on how well they have taken DOAC treatment (known as adherence), side effects, and whether they have had specific clinical events such as stroke, bleeding, and systemic embolism. This information will allow the researchers to calculate the rate of newly-occurring stroke, bleeding in the brain (symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage), and systemic embolism in the 90 day treatment period for each of the two groups (early and standard) so they can be compared. The impact of early versus standard treatment on participants’ quality of life and cognition will also be investigated by using specific assessments.",

Over 100,000 children and adults suffer from TBM yearly, of which up to half die and a quarter are left disabled. These appalling outcomes are driven by:I. Delay in diagnosis - there is no reliable test; II. Substandard antibiotic treatment – rifampicin, the key antibiotic, doesn’t reach an effective level in spinal fluid.This study aims to assess the levels of rifampicin in blood and spinal fluid, and monitor the safety and effects of this on death and disability.

Participants are treated in hospital for the first two weeks, then as an outpatient. They have blood samples taken, and physical and mental assessments throughout the trial.",
                "benefits_risks": "Participants benefit from careful medical follow-up during the 24 week trial period including blood tests, additional diagnostic tests on spinal fluid and brain scans where required. This follow-up is likely to be more detailed than the normal medical care in the public hospitals in Uganda, so potentially complications can be detected and managed earlier if people are in the trial. Additionally, transport costs and expenses are covered by the trial for follow-up appointments. Other studies using high dose rifampicin have shown that it is as safe as the standard dose, but these studies were in a different patient population. We will carefully monitor trial participants in case there are any safety issues with higher dose rifampicin in this patient population. Trial participants receive one to two additional lumbar punctures, which is likely to be more than they would have in routine hospital care in Uganda. This may have clinical benefits but lumbar punctures can rarely also cause harm (pain, infection, bleeding). Patients are counselled about these risks and lumbar punctures will be avoided if there are any concerns. ",

                "background_study_aims": "Neuropathic pain (also known as nerve pain) can arise from direct damage to the nervous system. Neuropathic pain is unbearable and existing treatments are often ineffective or cause significant side effects, which limits their use. In healthy people we can study the symptoms of neuropathic pain by applying capsaicin cream to the surface of the skin. Capsaicin is the ingredient that makes chilli peppers hot. Application of the cream to the skin usually causes a mild to moderate burning sensation in most people. There is also an increase in sensitivity to temperature and touch that can be measured using sensory tests. Researchers can therefore test the effects of new pain treatments. The effects of capsaicin are temporary and disappear when the cream is wiped off. However, conducting research in healthy people using capsaicin cream is extremely useful. It helps us predict the effectiveness of new pain treatments on the symptoms of neuropathic pain in patients. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered that Ivabradine may reduce pain by suppressing the abnormal firing of pain nerves. Ivabradine is not a completely new drug in humans. It is already licensed as a treatment for patients with chest pain (from heart disease) and the safety of Ivabradine has been shown in healthy volunteers. The aim of this study is to look at whether Ivabradine might be useful as a new treatment for nerve pain.",

                "study_involves": " Participants will attend hospital for a maximum of three visits (each visit will last 3-4 hours). Visit 1 will be a screening visit to find out if the volunteer is suitable to participate in the study. The study procedures will first be explained, and if the volunteer agrees to take part, they will be asked to sign an Informed Consent form. The volunteers response to a variety of stimuli applied to their forearm will then be assessed  these stimuli include a light touch with a soft brush, pokes with a brush filament and temperature tests  this is called Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). The volunteers response to capsaicin cream will then be tested by applying the cream to the skin of the forearm and repeating the QST. Not everyone will be suitable for the study, as some may not be sufficiently sensitive to the capsaicin cream, whereas others may find the cream too uncomfortable. Hence this screening visit  only those volunteers showing a suitable response to capsaicin will progress to the second and third visits. For those eligible to participate in the study, Visit 2 will take place about three weeks after Visit 1. Many of the tests performed in Visit 1 will be repeated in Visit 2, including the initial QST. However, before the application of the capsaicin cream, the volunteer will be asked to swallow tablets with water  these tablets will either be Ivabradine or a placebo (a dummy tablet), but neither the volunteer nor the study team will know which the tablets are. Following the application of the capsaicin cream, the QST will be repeated. Visit 3 will take place about one week after Visit 2, and will follow the same procedure used for Visit 2. However, the capsaicin cream will be applied to the arm opposite that used for Visit 2.",
                "benefits_risks": " This is a healthy volunteer study, and volunteers will not benefit from participating; however, information collected as part of your participation may benefit patients with neuropathic pain in the future. You will also receive an honorarium payment in compensation for your time and inconvenience. Risks associated with the capsaicin cream include: (a) it may cause a burning sensation upon application, (b) the skin where the capsaicin is applied may be sensitive for up to four hours (and may remain red for up to two hours) after the capsaicin is removed. However, these effects should completely disappear overnight or within 24 hours. As with other medications, some possible side effects may result from taking Ivabradine (please contact the study team for details); however, it is unlikely that these would be experienced by the volunteers on this study, who only take a single dose of this medication. Throughout the study visits, the volunteers will be closely monitored by the medical team to ensure there are no safety issues.",

                "study_hypothesis": "Chronic pain can arise from damage to the nervous system, which is known as nerve or neuropathic pain. Examples include sciatica, and pain caused by shingles or diabetes. Neuropathic pain is pernicious and treatments are often ineffective or limited by side effects.Experimental pain models have been developed in animals and humans which induce sensitisation via mechanisms that mimic those occurring in chronic pain patients. Laboratory-based investigations suggest that mice that have been bred so that their pain-transmitting nerves lack the gene encoding a protein called HCN2 do not develop the neuropathic pain symptoms.The HCN channel controls the initiation of electrical impulses within cells, and is well known for its role in controlling the heartbeat. HCN channels can be blocked by a drug called ivabradine, which is useful for the treatment of angina, is safe and effective, and is licensed for this use in the UK.A previous study (IISNeP)  investigated the effect of ivabradine on the symptoms of neuropathic pain, where sensitisation was induced on the forearm of healthy volunteers using capsaicin (the chemical that makes chilli peppers hot) cream. Ivabradine showed a trend to reduce sensitisation, but did not reach statistical significance.The choice of an enriched population study is justified by the preliminary evidence from our previous study (IISNeP) that some volunteers do not respond to capsaicin and therefore there is no window to see an effect of ivabradine. This method of screening for capsaicin responders and non-responders prior to the study has been reported previously.Healthy volunteers will be recruited to take part in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. A prior screening session will allow training of volunteers in the sensory tests, and function to select capsaicin responders for the study based on the amount of sensitisation they exhibit.",

                "background_study_aims": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of vision loss in people over 50. It involves the gradual damage to a part of the eye called the macula. The macula is a tiny area at the centre of the retina (the layer at the back of the eye which is sensitive to light), which is responsible for central vision (seeing what is directly ahead). Over time, the damage to the macula can lead to central vision becoming distorted or blurry, eventually causing a blank patch in the centre of your vision. In most cases, AMD is caused by fatty-protein deposits called drusen collecting under the retina (dry AMD) over a long period of time; however, currently there is no cure or effective treatment for this type. About 10% of people suffering from AMD have what is known as wet AMD (or neovascular AMD). In wet AMD, the macula becomes damaged and new blood vessels start to grow behind the retina. These blood vessels are generally very weak and prone to leakage, causing the macula to swell and vision to deteriorate very quickly. Aflibercept is a drug treatment known as an anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor). By injecting it directly into the eye, it works by preventing the weak, leaky blood vessels from growing (by blocking the action of the protein responsible). Currently, the recommended dose is 2mg once every eight weeks after the loading dose (initial large dose of a medicine used to ensure quick benefits), however more research is needed to find out if this is the most appropriate dose for everyone. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of standard treatment to a treat and extend regime, which uses the initial phases of a regimen to find the best dosing regimen for an individual patient.",

                "study_involves": "Participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups. Participants in both groups receive an initial three 2mg doses of aflibercept, given by intravitreal injection (an injection into the eye), spaced four weeks apart. Following this, for participants in the first group, the interval between treatments is extended to once every 8 weeks for the first year of treatment. In the second year of treatment, the treating physician can extend the intervals between treatments at their discretion. For participants in the second group, the treating physician is able to extend the treatment intervals at their discretion until the most appropriate dosing regimen for each individual participant is found. At the end of the study, the potential benefits of each dosing method are compared, in order to find the best way to conduct a larger study in the future. ",

The following clinical parameters were assessed: periodontal pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), full mouth bleeding score (FMBS), and full-mouth plaque score (FMPS). The evaluation of the periodontal parameters was recorded in the periodontal chart (http://www.periodontalchart-online.com/uk/), saved in a .pdf format, printed and attached to each  patient’s observation file, at baseline and at the three months reevaluation by measuring the PPD and the CAL at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal, disto-lingual, lingual and mesio-lingual) at all teeth, excluding third molars, to the nearest millimeter, with a periodontal probe (PCPUNC 15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA), using the cement–enamel junction (CEJ) as a reference point for the CAL. When CEJ was missing (prosthodontic restoration), measurements was made using as reference point the most apically located margin of the restoration. Tooth mobility was recorded based on the Miller classification (Miller 1985), and the furcation involvement (FI) was classified according to Hamp et al. 1975, using a Nabers probe #2N hdl #7, markings: 3-6-9-12mm, (Hu-Friedy®, Chicago, IL, USA).After the measurements, all pockets with PPD≥4 mm were scaled and root planed under local anesthesia by the same clinician (SB) with Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy®, Chicago, IL, USA) and ultrasonic instruments (Piezon®250, Electro Medical Systems SA, Nyon, Switzerland), following the protocol of One-Stage-Full-Mouth-Disinfection (OSFMD, Quirynen et al. 1995). As home care, patients were advised to rinse twice daily for 2 min. with a 0.2% Chlorhexidine digluconate solution (Dentaton, Ghimas S.p.A., Casalecchio di Reno, Bologna, Italy) for 14 days. At the end of the non-surgical therapy session, one investigator (the randomizer, SIS) allocated each patient to one of the three treatment groups using a number generator (www.random.org). Every position on the randomization list corresponded to a medication package number related to a pre-packed medication bag, which contained the instructions for intake as well. The medication bags were handed to each patient.In group A (control), patients were treated only with non-surgical periodontal treatment and received a placebo treatment for 7 days (N = 14). In group B (test), patients were treated with non-surgical periodontal treatment combined with systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole (SRP + AMX + MET), 500 mg three times daily (TID) for 3 days and placebo for 4 days (N = 16). In group C (test) patients were treated with non-surgical periodontal treatment combined with SRP + AMX + MET, 500 mg TID, 7 days (N = 16).Each medication bag contained four identical vials, each one with tasteless and identical type of capsules. Each vial was numbered, and each patient was instructed to take one capsule from each vial every 8 hours, as follows: from vial No. 1 and 2 in the first 3 days after SRP and from vial No. 3 and 4 in the following 4 days.The placebo group (group A) had only placebo capsules in all vials. Group B had AMX and MET in vials No. 1 and 2, and placebo in vials No. 3 and 4. Group C had AMX and MET in all four vials. The medication bags were prepared in the Department of Periodontology of the Faculty of Dental Medicine. A recall appointment to ask the patient about any adverse reactions or any breach of inclusion criteria was scheduled at 2 weeks after the beginning of the medication intake.",

The pancreas is then unable to produce any insulin, a hormone that normally controls the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. This results in the blood glucose level becoming too high. The aim is to develop a treatment that can slow or stop this process by switching off the white blood cells causing the damage. This treatment involves a molecule similar to insulin attached to small particles of gold (nanoparticles). The aim of this study is to investigate whether this treatment is safe with no significant side-effects.",

When newly diagnosed, many T1D patients still have 10-20% of their insulin-producing cells still functioning. Ustekinumab is currently being used for other skin and bowel conditions and works by blocking the body's immune system. The aim of this study is to find out whether Ustekinumab can delay or stop those remaining insulin-producing cells from being destroyed. If the drug works, it can potentially improve a patient's ability to control their blood sugar levels.",

                "study_involves": "Participants are tested to see if they still have insulin-producing cells left, and if they do, they are randomly allocated to take either Ustekinumab or a placebo (dummy drug) as seven doses over 44 weeks. Blood and urine samples are collected for testing at study visits, which where possible coincide with their routine appointments. The participant and a nominated parent are also asked to complete three quality of life questionnaires. At week 52 there is a follow up appointment at the hospital, after which the researchers remotely follow up their health status using hospital records for another year. All females are asked to take adequate contraceptive protection and undergo pregnancy tests at the study visits. ",
                "benefits_risks": "Ustekinumab may help the pancreas make insulin for longer. However, this cannot be said for certain until this study is completed. During the study the participants’ diabetes will be very closely monitored. This will include regular check-ups with the local diabetes team including routine blood testing. They will have more time with the research team to discuss their diabetes and ask questions than at a normal clinic appointment. They will be provided with a FREE Abbott Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system. They can use this to check their blood sugar levels while they are in the study, although they will still be asked to do some finger prick tests. During the Milkshake test, participants may experience changes in blood glucose level because they will not have taken insulin immediately beforehand. The study nurses and doctors will be available to help them make any changes to their usual insulin doses after this test. Because the medicine (Ustekinumab) acts on the immune system, there is a possibility that it will increase the risk of infections and cancer, but so far this has not been found to be a problem with people treated with this medicine for other diseases. It is also possible that participants may get an allergic reaction to the treatment injection. They will stay for one hour after their first injection to check for any reactions. Participants will have a chest X-ray to rule out TB which is additional to standard care. Chest x-rays involve using ionising radiation to form images of the body. Ionising radiation can cause cell damage in the longer term which can sometimes lead to cancer developing. However, only one x-ray is needed so taking part in this study will add only a very small chance of this happening. The risk is not much greater than that found with natural background radiation.",

The overarching hypothesis is that interrupting the IL-17 and IFN-γ axes in individuals with recent-onset T1D will halt or slow the autoimmune destruction of beta cells sufficient to permit beta cell preservation and maintain residual physiological insulin secretion. Given the therapeutic success of biologics that target immune molecules in other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and the evidence that IL-17 and IFN-γ producing cells are pathogenic to beta cells, we propose that drugs already approved for use in humans (e.g. Ustekinumab) may be beneficial for the treatment of T1D.",

                "background_study_aims": "Influenza, known as the flu, is a common viral infection that can cause symptoms such as high fevers, chills, tiredness, muscle aches, headache and cough.  Most otherwise healthy people make a full recovery from a flu infection.  However, people with certain health problems such as severe asthma, or very young or elderly people may develop life-threatening complications from the flu. There are many different types of flu virus and the virus changes frequently. Therefore vaccination cannot guarantee protection against all types of flu. Current treatments for flu that can be bought from a pharmacy may alleviate only some of the symptoms. Treatments that can be prescribed by a doctor must be taken over several days and may slightly shorten the duration of the flu but do not work for all types of flu. The aim of this study is to look at how radiolabelled S-033188 (the study drug) is taken up, broken down and removed from the body when taken by mouth as an oral suspension (a drink). ‘Radiolabelled’ means that the test drug has a radioactive component, a tag, which helps us to track where the drug goes as it moves through and out of the body. It is hoped that the study drug will provide information about a treatment for flu that can be taken as a one-off dose and will decrease the duration and complications of flu infection.",

The study visit involves receiving the study drug on Day 1. The same tests are carried out as at the screening visit, along with collection of blood, urine and faecal samples to measure the amount of drug and the amount of radioactivity in the blood, urine and faeces. Participants also provide blood samples to see how their genes affect their response to the drug. The follow-up visit is a short visit lasting about 30 minutes to ensure that volunteers' health is in the same condition as before they started the study, which includes blood and urine samples, ECG, vital signs and physical examination.",

                "background_study_aims": "Malaria is still a major health problem in Tanzania and many other parts of Africa. Many people with malaria do not get appropriate treatment, and at the same time, people that do not have malaria continue to get treated with antimalarial drugs. Not receiving the recommended treatment can be dangerous, as older medicines that contain sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and chloroquine are no longer very effective at killing the parasites that cause malaria. Taking antimalarial drugs when malaria has not been confirmed can also be dangerous, as many other illnesses have symptoms similar to malaria and require different treatments. In addition, widespread use of antimalarial drugs can cause the parasites to get used to the drug and develop resistance, so that they are no longer killed by the medicine. The latest and most effective antimalarial drugs are called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are combinations of drugs, and have been shown to be very effective at killing all the malaria parasites. The ACT that is recommended by the government in Tanzania is called artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Recently, the government has been promoting cheaper AL with a green leaf on the package; the cost of these medicines is subsidized by international donors. These drugs can be sold in drug shops called Duka la Dawa Muhimu (DLDM). Dispensers at DLDM are supposed to receive special training on dispensing AL. Patient adherence, the extent to which patients promptly and correctly take the full course of a drug, is a key component in ensuring drug effectiveness. As ACTs become more widely available in the private sector, monitoring their use is critical to their success.  This study in Mtwara region, Tanzania will be comprised of two major activities: (1) a trial to assess adherence to AL among patients obtaining AL at Duka la Dawa Muhimu (DLDM) and those obtaining AL at DLDM where dispensers will receive a text message reminder intervention and an observational assessment of patient adherence to AL obtained from public health facilities.",

                "study_involves": "Beginning one month prior to data collection, dispensers at half of the DLDM will receive text message reminders of appropriate advice to provide when dispensing AL. The content of these messages will be based on materials used by the government to train dispensers at DLDM. Patients who are prescribed an ACT in public health facilities or who want to purchase ACTs at DLDM will be given age or weight-appropriate blister packs of AL supplied by the study. Half of the patients from each group will receive normal blister packs and half will receive blister packs containing electronic labels that measure the day and time each blister is opened. These patients will be visited at their homes a minimum of 75 hours after they obtain treatment, and they will be asked to consent to an interview about their visit to the drug outlet and how each dose of medication was taken. A pill count will be conducted and blister packs will be collected. Dispensers at DLDM will also be interviewed about their characteristics and knowledge of advice to give patients when dispensing AL. ",

                "background_study_aims": "Ebola outbreaks have been occurring in Africa for the past 40 years with several hundreds of people being infected and a high number of them dying quickly. The major outbreak in West Africa was the largest in history and recorded more than 11, 000 deaths. One case was reported in Senegal that was imported from Conakry.  This means that the outbreak can quickly spread in many other countries. Participants involved in the study EBL06 received 2 vaccines. The first was ChAd3-EBO Z and 7 days later the second vaccine was MVA-EBO Z. The results from this study show that both the vaccines were safe and well tolerated, and induced a strong immune response. In this study the participants are invited back to receive another vaccine and have some further blood tests to find out how long the immune response has lasted, and if the vaccine is potentially capable of providing protection against the Ebola virus infection. The study will also look at whether giving another vaccine will increase the duration of this response. An Ebola vaccine called Ad26-ZEBOV is being tested as a booster to see if it will be an effective vaccination strategy against Ebola. ",
                "who_can_participate": "Senegalese adult men and women who took part in the EBL 06 study ",
                "study_involves": "Participants come for five study visits over a period of one year. At the screening visit they are asked to provide information about their medical history. The study doctor also performs a medical examination and laboratory tests including urinary and blood tests to ensure that they are eligible for this study. A maximum of 8 ml of blood is collected for this (about half a tablespoon). All female volunteers must be willing to practice effective contraception from the time of consent until 3 months after they have had the vaccine. Pregnancy tests are conducted on the day of vaccination. Female volunteers must also not be breastfeeding or planning to until 3 months after they have had the vaccine. An HIV test is carried out on the blood collected. Before the test, a trained counsellor explains the HIV test to the participant. They are told the result and given advice about the meaning of it. Only the investigators and authorised personnel have access to the results of the blood tests. If participants are found to be HIV infected, they are referred to an approved HIV clinic for further care. If they do not want to have an HIV test they do not have to but they cannot participate in this study. If the results of the tests indicate that they can participate in the study and they still want to participate, participants attend an appointment at IRESSEF for the enrolment visit. If the results of the tests indicate that they have conditions that do not allow them to take part in the study, they are referred for medical care and do not participate in the study. If for any number of reasons the vaccine study needs to be stopped, participants are informed and have normal medical care. The vaccines are given into the muscle of the non-dominant upper arm (deltoid). Participants are requested to wait at the IRESSEF clinic for one hour after the vaccination to check if they are well before going home. If they experience an immediate adverse reaction after the vaccination, they are requested to stay at the clinic until the emergency physician decides to send them home. After they have gone home, if they have difficulty in using the diary card with a thermometer and a ruler, staff visit them at home every day to assess if they have any side effects of the vaccine, until six days after vaccination. Literate participants complete the diary card at home for 6 days after the vaccination. Participants are asked to attend the clinic at the trial site on Days 7, 28, and 365 after vaccination. Over one year five blood samples are collected with 8-36 ml (about one to two tablespoons) taken at each visit; the total amount of blood taken is about 9 tablespoons (134 ml). The blood samples are needed to see whether the body is building a response to the vaccines, indicating that the vaccines are working. ",
                "benefits_risks": "If participants are sick at any time during the study, they receive free treatment. Participants do not get paid for participation in the study, but the costs for the transport will be reimbursed. The vaccine may not provide protection against Ebola so participants should follow all known preventive measures against Ebola. The vaccine may cause some changes in colour of the skin at the injection site, which should go away in a few days. Also, there could be pain, swelling or itching at the injection site. Participants may experience a mild fever lasting for two or three days after vaccination. Other common side effects that may occur include headache, muscle pain, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and rarely, fast breathing, convulsion and unknown reactions may occur. A few people reported ‘tingling’ in their hands and feet, and muscle weakness, but it is not known if they received AD26.ZEBOV or a placebo. These symptoms usually got better after 24-48 hours, but sometimes lasted for a few weeks before going away on their own. In one more serious case the tingling, numbness and loss of pain sensation has been ongoing for several months, which may be due to nerve damage. With any vaccine, there is a small risk of more serious reactions such as a bad allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), including a rash, hives, or difficulty breathing. Some allergic reactions can be life-threatening, therefore trained personnel with resuscitation equipment will be immediately available to treat any such reactions. Changes in blood tests have been seen in some people after the vaccine. These include anaemia (low levels of red blood cells) and low levels of potassium, but the people with these changes did not have any symptoms. The effect of the study vaccine(s) on sperm, egg, conception, pregnancy, an unborn child or a breastfed infant has not been studied. There is currently no information on possible effects of the study vaccine(s) in these cases. Insurance cover and treatment is provided for any injury caused by procedures related to this study. ",

Following this, patients will be allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to Cohorts B-D.If it is available, the hospital research team will provide the PHOENIX researchers with tumour tissue collected from the original breast cancer diagnosis.PRE-TREATMENT SAMPLE COLLECTION DAY -1 TO 1 (OR DAY -1 TO 5 FOR COHORT B)Prior to the start of the 2-week window between completing chemotherapy and surgery (and to commencing trial treatment for those allocated to a treatment cohort), patients will have a new marker inserted into the tumour, in order to guide the research biopsies collected in PHOENIX. A research biopsy will be collected during the same procedure and 4 cores will be collected guided by the new marker via ultrasound scan. A blood sample will also be collected at this time point.TRIAL TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERYPatients allocated to a treatment cohort will receive trial treatment in the 2-week window between completing chemotherapy and having breast cancer surgery.ON-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS DAY 7 (COHORT C ONLY)Patients in Cohort C will have an additional visit on Day 7 of trial treatment:- Discussion about changes in health or medications since the previous visitDAY 14 ASSESSMENTSOn the final day of the 2-week window before surgery, patients will have:- Discussion about changes in health or medications since the previous visit- Physical examination- Blood test for routine safety checks- Pre-operative sample collection, as described belowPRE-OPERATIVE SAMPLE COLLECTION DAY 14On Day 14 of the window of opportunity and prior to surgery, a second biopsy guided by the marker inserted at baseline via ultrasound scan and research blood samples will be collected.Patients in cohort A will not receive trial treatment in the window between completing chemotherapy and surgery but the research biopsies and blood samples described above will still be collected. Cohort A is important as it will help to work out whether any changes we see in cohorts B, C or D are due to the trial treatment, due to the biopsies, or due to another reason.SURGERYAll patients will proceed to breast cancer surgery as planned. The research team at site will provide the PHOENIX researchers with tumour tissue collected during surgery.30-DAY POST SURGERY FOLLOW UPAll patients will be seen 30 days after surgery for a safety follow up visit. Assessments carried out in this visit will be:- Discussion about changes in health or medications since the previous visit- A physical examination- An electrocardiogram- Blood test for routine safety checks- Patients will also donate a research blood sample during this 30-day post-surgery follow up visit.3-MONTH POST-SURGERY FOLLOW UPAll patients will be seen 3 months after surgery for a safety follow up visit. Assessments carried out in this visit will be:- Discussion about changes in health or medications since the previous visit- A physical examination- An electrocardiogram- Blood test for routine safety checksAt the 3-month post-surgery follow up visit, patients will find out from their trial doctor or nurse whether they are suitable for continuation to PHOENIX PART 2.PATIENTS NOT CONTINUING TO PART 2:This will include all patients in Cohort A, patients for whom a trackable mutations has not been identified in their tumour tissue provided in PART 1, and patients who for any reason do not wish to continue with the trial further. No further visits will be required for these patients for PHOENIX, but we will collect follow up information on how patients are doing every 3 months for a period of 2 years, including any relapses or further treatment received.INFORMED CONSENT FOR PART 2If patients are suitable for continuation to PHOENIX PART 2, they will receive a verbal explanation of the next part of the trial, together with the cohort specific Patient Information Sheet for Continuation to PART 2, which they can take home with them. Patients will be given sufficient time to consider whether they want to continue in the trial and will have the opportunity to raise any questions before deciding whether to continue. Should they choose to continue to PART 2, they will be asked to sign a consent form to record their informed consent.ctDNA SCREENING:A blood sample for ctDNA screening will be collected from all patients consenting for continuation to PART 2.FOLLOW UP OF PATIENTS WITH A ctDNA NEGATIVE RESULT:If ctDNA is not found to be present in the blood sample provided for ctDNA screening or tests show that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body but the patient is not suitable to resume trial treatment in PART 2 for any other reason, we will continue to collect blood samples from the patient every 3 months for a period of 24 months. We will also collect information on how the patients are doing during this time, including any relapses or further treatment received.PATIENTS WITH A ctDNA POSITIVE RESULT:If ctDNA is found to be present in the blood sample provided for ctDNA screening patients will undergo an imaging assessment to see whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The imaging will be either a CT scan and bone scan, or an FDG PET-CT scan, depending on the hospital's usual process.If the scan shows the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, patients will not be able to resume trial treatment within PHOENIX. Instead, their trial doctor will discuss treatment options available outside of the PHOENIX trial. No further visits will be required for these patients for PHOENIX, but we will collect information on how the patients are doing every 3 months for a period of 2 years, including any relapses or further treatment received.If the scan does not show any evidence that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, patients may be able to resume trial treatment for 12 months within PART 2, provided that pre-treatment assessments show they are suitable to resume treatment.PART 2 PRE-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS:The following pre-treatment assessments will be conducted on Day -28 to -1 prior to resuming trial treatment:- Scan, as described above, to confirm no evidence on imaging that the cancer has spread- Electrocardiogram- Discussion about changes in health since the previous visitThe following pre-treatment assessments will be conducted on Day -3 to -1 prior to resuming of trial treatment:- Discussion about changes in medication since the previous visit- Physical exam- Blood test for routine safety checks- A pregnancy test (for all women who are able to get pregnant)PART 2 TRIAL TREATMENT - ADJUVANT SETTING FOR 12 MONTHS:Patients confirmed as suitable to resume trial treatment in PART 2 will receive the same trial treatment as received in PART 1 in 4-weekly cycles for 12 months (13 cycles) with ctDNA blood samples collected every 4 weeks:- CohortB - AZD6738: tablets taken twice daily, for the first 2 weeks of each cycle- Cohort C - Olaparib: tablets to be taken twice daily, every day of each cycle- Cohort D - durvalumab: an infusion on day 1 of each cyclePART 2 ON-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS:The following assessments will be conducted on Day 1 of each cycle (cycles 2 -13), before the first dose is taken:- Discussion about changes in health or medications since the previous visit- A physical examination- Electrocardiogram- A pregnancy test (for all women who are able to get pregnant)- Blood test for routine safety checks- Blood samples taken for researchEND OF TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS:The following assessments will be conducted at the time of treatment discontinuation:- Medication and symptoms review- Physical examination- Electrocardiogram- Blood test for routine safety checks- Blood samples taken for researchPOST-TREATMENT SAFETY FOLLOW UP - 30 DAYS (AND 90 DAYS FOR COHORT D ONLY) POST-TREATMENTDISCONTINUATION:The following assessments will be conducted at the post-treatment safety follow up visit 30 days (and 90 days for Cohort D only) after treatment discontinuation:- Discussion about changes in health or medications since the previous visit- Physical exam- Electrocardiogram- A pregnancy test (for all women who are able to get pregnant)- Blood test for routine safety checks (30 days only)FOLLOW UP:Patients will be followed up for a further 12 months after treatment discontinuation (or total of 24 months from the 3 month post-surgery visit if treatment is discontinued earlier than 12 months) with a research blood sample collected every 3 months and information collected on how the patient is doing during this time, including any relapses or further treatment received.",

                "background_study_aims": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In most cases, young people aged 20 to 40 are diagnosed with MS, with women being around three times as often affected as men. Damage to the nerve sheaths leads to a variety of symptoms in MS. Specific treatment of these symptoms and improvement in everyday activities are important goals for people with MS. To be able to measure the present health status of individuals and assess the effects of treatment, suitable measurement tools are necessary. These tools need to be precise, valid and reliable. This refers also to subjective instruments such as questionnaires. These tools can be used to measure patients' perception of their health status or disease-related health problems. Certainly, the questions in any questionnaire need to be in the respective language of the people under investigation. These translated questionnaires are required to be validated, too. In their next study, the researchers are interested in the effects of a physiotherapy intervention on physical functioning and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is a person’s belief in his or her ability to achieve goals. Studies have shown that high self-efficacy levels are related to better health outcomes in people with MS. So far, the researchers are not aware of any validated German questionnaire for measuring self-efficacy in people with MS. Therefore, they plan to translate the original English Unidimensional Self-Efficacy Scale for MS (USE-MS) into German and to validate the German version for people with MS living in Austria.",

                "background_study_aims": "In adrenal Insufficiency (AI), the body is unable to produce vital steroid hormones, the chief of these being cortisol. There are about 27,000 individuals in the UK with AI, with up to 3140 new cases per year. The main treatment is replacement of the absent hormone with tablets. This is commonly done using hydrocortisone, taken 3 times daily. Correctly replacing the hormones is a significant challenge. If an individual is given too much hydrocortisone, they risk long term complications including diabetes, osteoporosis (weakened bones) and cardiovascular disease (heart attacks). If, however, they are given too little, patients can feel tired, unwell and may collapse as there is insufficient steroid hormone to cope with stress. As hydrocortisone is eliminated by the body very quickly, it must be taken three times a day to maintain adequate levels, and omitting a dose can be dangerous. This study will look at hydrocortisone as well as an alternative steroid hormone for replacement called prednisolone. Prednisolone is similar to hydrocortisone but is eliminated more slowly, requiring only once daily administration. For the purposes of hormone replacement, prednisolone should be used in much smaller doses than typically used for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, prednisolone was used in one-size-fits-all doses of 7.5 mg daily but this caused side effects such as weakening of the bones (osteoporosis) and high blood sugar (diabetes). It is now known that we can prevent these problems by the following plan: (1) we can reduce the dose required for replacement to 3-5 mg a day; (2) by using a blood test to measure the amount of prednisolone remaining in the blood 8 hours after a given dose of prednisolone, we can confirm the right dose of prednisolone for each patient: 3, 4 or 5 mg. Using this plan, we can ensure that patients get the right dose of prednisolone, and minimise any side effects. The aim of this study is to compare low-dose prednisolone with standard hydrocortisone replacement to ensure that low-dose prednisolone is equivalent to standard hydrocortisone treatment in terms of replacing the steroid hormone needs of patients with AI, and in terms of maintaining their overall health.",
                "who_can_participate": "Patients aged 18 – 70 with AI ",
                "study_involves": "The participants are randomly allocated to treatment witheither  (a) 4 months of once daily prednisolone (at the determined dose with placebo at midday and the afternoon) followed by a 2-week washout period followed by 4 months of standard thrice daily hydrocortisone, or (b) 4 months of standard thrice daily hydrocortisone followed by the same washout period and then 4 months of prednisolone. Patients and doctors do not know whether they are taking prednisolone in the first 4 months or the second 4 months as the prednisolone and the hydrocortisone have been specifically made for this study. During each of these 4 month periods, participants are asked to attend the study centre 3 times on Day 1, Day 30 and Day 120 for study visits. This means there is a total of 6 study visits  (two 4-month study periods). During each study visit, participants attend having fasted from the night before and having taken their morning steroid tablet at an individualised fixed time. The visit involves: having measurements such as weight, heart rate, and blood pressure taken; providing a urine sample; providing a blood sample; and completing questionnaires. In all, the study visits should take no longer than 3 hours. In between the three study visits, there are also telephone consultations to follow each participant up and to ensure that they are safe.",
                "benefits_risks": "The information from this study may help us to understand better how to treat future patients who do not produce enough steroid naturally. Participants will not benefit directly from participating in the study. We will not take any more than 450 ml of blood over a 3-month period. This is about the same amount of blood taken in a single blood donation. Furthermore, on any single visit day we will not take more than 50 ml (about 10 teaspoons). This is a safe amount of blood loss. Participants will be monitored to ensure that they do not become anaemic. As blood is being drawn in this study, there is a risk of slight pain when this is done, and a bruise may remain for a short period after blood is taken. As participants will be changing their steroid treatment as part of this study, there is a risk of undertreatment. This risk will be minimised as patients will be trialled on the new regimen if they have not previously received it before. Possible symptoms will include tiredness, dizziness, pre-syncope, syncope, palpitations, and abdominal pain. These will be detected through symptom reporting, which will take place during all visits and telephone consultations. Participants will also have a 24-hour emergency contact number for a study clinician which they will be instructed to call if they feel unwell.",

                "background_study_aims": ":Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a virus that causes infection of the liver and can live in the body for long periods of time, often without causing symptoms. Over time (many years) the virus damages the liver by causing inflammation and scarring. Eventually, patients can develop liver failure and liver cancer. New drugs to cure hepatitis C have become available in recent years. They can be taken by mouth, for shorter periods of time than previous treatments. They have fewer side-effects, and much better cure rates. Unfortunately, the tablets are expensive. This study is investigating ways of reducing the costs of curing hepatitis C, by comparing different tablet combinations and different treatment schedules.  ",

Everyone in this study will get a combination of tablets that has been shown to cure hepatitis C. The study will involve attending regularly clinical assessments at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. The frequency and timing of visits depends on each study group. At each visit the patient will see the study doctors who will conduct a physical examination, ask questions about the participant's health and medications to assess the patients response to treatment, and perform blood tests needed for the study. This will include blood tests to check kidney and liver function, the level of virus in the blood, and the amount of DAA drugs in the blood. ",
                "benefits_risks": "The main benefit of participation is that most participants (over 19 out of 20)  will be cured of hepatitis C, with most being cured on the first round of treatment or a second round if the first does not clear all the virus. There are some common side effects associated with the study medicines. These include fatigue, headache, insomnia, dizziness, migraine, nausea, diarrhea, stomach ache, and pains in the muscles and joints. There is also a small risk that the shorter courses of treatment might not cure the participant's hepatitis C and that their virus might become resistant to the drugs used, which might reduce the options for alternative treatments. The study involves several samples of blood being taken, which can be uncomfortable or painful and can produce bruising.",

All potential participants will be identified for screening in the out-patient department of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City. As part of their standard care, patients with suspected HCV infection will have routine laboratory tests, including full blood count, liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), liver ultrasound, fibroscan and HBsAg. These tests will be used to identify participants who may be suitable for screening.The study is a parallel-group open-label factorial trial simultaneously addressing optimal direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen, treatment-shortening strategies, and the role of adjunctive ribavirin. Specifically each participant will be randomized factorially to: 1. Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) versus sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) in a 1:1 ratio2. Standard 12-week duration versus response-guided therapy (RGT) versus induction/maintenance versus PEG-interferon (PEG-IFN)/DAA ultra-short treatment in a 1:2:2:2 ratio to evaluate three strategies to achieve high cure rates with reduced drug treatment3. Patients receiving the last 3 shortening strategies will be additionally randomized factorially to adjunctive ribavirin (RBV) or no RBV in a 1:1 ratioRandomisation will be stratified by G6 versus all other HCV genotypes. The novel study design simultaneously evaluates many different aspects of treatment analogous to a multi-arm multistage (MAMS)/seamless Phase II/III design, accelerating the identification of the best strategies to put into practice, whilst enabling poorly performing approaches to be identified and dropped swiftly by regular monitoring.All patients will receive 400 mg SOF and 60 mg DCV once daily or 400 mg SOF and 100 mg VEL once daily. Those in the standard 12-week arm will receive 12 weeks of treatment, dispensed every 4 weeks. They will attend for visits at week 2, 4, 8, 12. Those in the RGT arm will be dispensed 4 weeks of treatment at enrolment. A single quantitative viral load will be performed at a visit on Day 7 and treatment duration will determined by this viral load at the time of the Week 4 visit. Based on predicted kinetics, individuals with virus below the Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) (12 IU/ml, Abbott assay or alternative equivalent) at Day 7 will be treated for 4 weeks, those with viral load between the LLOQ and 250 IU/ml will receive 8 weeks, with all others continuing for 12 weeks of total therapy. They will attend for visits at week 1, 4, 8 (if receiving ≥8 weeks treatment), and 12 (if receiving 12 weeks treatment). Drug will be dispensed every 4 weeks.Those in the induction/maintenance arm will be dispensed 2 weeks of treatment and start standard daily therapy at enrolment. After 2 weeks, treatment will be administered on the basis of 5 days on, 2 days off with treatment breaks to coincide with the weekend. Participants will return to the clinic at 2 weeks, and will take the next following weekend off treatment, and all subsequent weekends off. They will attend for visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, and drug will be dispensed at 2 and 8 weeks.Those receiving ultrashort therapy with PEGylated interferon will receive additional weekly PEG-IFN for a total of 4 doses on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Drug will be administered at weekly clinic visits at Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.Patients randomised to RBV will take ribavirin tablets for as long as they take DAA therapy i.e. for 4, 8 or 12 weeks in the RGT arm depending on viral load at Day 7, for 12 weeks in the induction/maintenance treatment arm (missing RBV doses on weekends off treatment), and 4 weeks in the ultra-short PEG-IFN/DAA treatment arm. The dose will be 1000 mg taken once daily with DAAs, with dose adjustment for renal impairment and anaemia if indicated.",

                "acronym": "TAILoR",
                "study_hypothesis": "TAILoR is a phase II multi-centre, randomised, open labelled, dose ranging trial of telmisartan in HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to investigate whether telmisartan can reduce insulin resistance observed in this patient population.Patients with HIV treated by cART are at risk of developing certain serious side effects such as reduced response to insulin (insulin resistance), abnormal body fat distribution (HIV lipodystrophy) and high cholesterol levels leading to diabetes, and importantly, an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. A key abnormality seems to be insulin resistance which will develop in almost all patients during the course of anti-HIV therapy. There is a need to find new strategies to reduce insulin resistance in HIV-positive individuals treated with cART, which ultimately will reduce the associated cardiovascular risk.Telmisartan, a widely used anti hypertensive drug, has been shown to reduce insulin resistance and improve various indicators (biomarkers) of cardiovascular health in non-HIV population. However, whether telmisartan is effective for insulin resistance and other metabolic side effects in HIV patients treated by cART is not known. We also need to identify the most appropriate dose of telmisartan that is effective in reducing the metabolic side effects in HIV patients.TAILoR will use a novel adaptive trial design to compare three different doses of telmisartan with the control group (those who do not take telmisartan) to determine the effect on insulin resistance over a period of 48 weeks. We will recruit 370 HIV-positive patients from multiple specialist centres across the UK and patients will be randomised to one of the four arms. If telmisartan shows a significant beneficial effect on insulin resistance, a larger phase III study to assess its effect on cardiovascular morbidity will be conducted in HIV-positive individuals treated with cART.",

                "background_study_aims": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition causing pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. The main aim of this study is to find out how much of the drug seliciclib can be given to  patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have active RA despite treatment with anti-TNF monotherapy. ",
                "who_can_participate": "Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis",
                "study_involves": "In stage 1, patients are grouped into seven groups of three patients each. They receive 200mg, 400mg, 600mg, 800mg or 1000mg seliciclib once daily for 4 consecutive days every week for 4 cycles. This determines the highest dose of seliciclib for stage 2. In stage 2, 18 participants receive seliciclib at the dose found in stage 1 for 12 cycles. Blood samples are taken during the study and in stage 2 small biopsies (samples) are taken from the lining of one of the joints (synovial biopsy) and participants may have an optional PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computerized tomography) scan.",
                "benefits_risks": "There may be no direct benefit to participants taking part in this study although it is possible that their arthritis symptoms will improve. If seliciclib is found to be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis this may result in an alternative treatment that helps people with rheumatoid arthritis who have not experienced benefit from the currently available drugs. Seliciclib has previously been successfully tested on patients with certain types of cancer, but this is the first time this drug has been used in rheumatoid arthritis. All drugs can have side effects. The most commonly occurring side-effects encountered by patients taking seliciclib in cancer studies were fatigue (tiredness) and nausea (feeling sick), in the great majority of cases the symptoms experienced were not considered severe. Possible side-effects are monitored by the study doctors and, where possible, treatment is given to relieve symptoms. It is not known whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking seliciclib will encounter the same side-effects as those with cancer. Taking blood samples may cause some discomfort and minor pain, and occasionally patients feel faint during or after the procedure. Sometimes patients have some bruising where the blood has been taken. Trained members of staff perform these procedures and every effort is made to prevent these problems.  A local anaesthetic is used to numb the skin and joint to minimise any discomfort during the biopsy. The doctor uses ultrasound to guide them to the part of the joint to take samples from, to minimise the chance of complications. There may be some mild bruising after the procedure. As the local anaesthetic wears off after the procedure, up to one third of patients experience mild, temporary pain or discomfort which usually disappears within 24 hours. Very rarely (with a risk of less than 1 in 500) more significant complications may occur, such as an infection of the joint or skin, bleeding into the joint, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot), neurological (nerve) damage or thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a superficial vein). The procedure may leave a small (2-3 mm or 1/8 inch) scar. PET-CT scans involve the use of x-rays and gamma rays which are forms of radiation. Exposure to radiation is associated with increasing the risk of subsequent cancer. Everyone is exposed to natural or background radiation and everyone is at risk of developing cancer at some point. The overall risk of any of us developing cancer is about 1 in 3, and the additional risk for the PET-CT scan is considered to be very small. The benefits of the increased information from the test is thought to justify the use of radiation for this purpose. The dose of radiation that a participant would be exposed to is still well within the acceptable safety limits for radiation exposure. ",

                "background_study_aims": " The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the immune system, making an affected person less able to fight infection and disease. It can be caught though unprotected sex, sharing drug needles, via transfusions of contaminated blood and blood products and from the mother to her baby during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. There is no cure for the condition, but there are a number of drug treatments that enable HIV+ people to live a  long and healthy life. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  is the last stage of HIV infection, at which point the immune system is unable to fight life-threatening infections. With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV do not  go on to develop AIDS. SMILE is a study that will compare two different HIV (antiretroviral) medicine combinations. Taking antiretroviral medicines every day without missing a dose is important. This is to stop the virus becoming resistant which can happen if the virus levels in the blood are not low enough. However, some young people experience difficulty in taking several medications every day, particularly if this is more than once a day, and so doctors and scientists are now working towards easier ways for people to take the medicines. Newer antiretrovirals which are taken once daily include Prezista (darunavir) which is taken with a small dose of Norvir (ritonavir) and dolutegravir. In SMILE we will examine whether it is safe and effective to take Prezista + Norvir + dolutegravir compared to continuing to take current antiretroviral medications. Also, NRTIs are a particularly prone to cause adverse side effects. Therefore it may be important to reduce cumulative NRTI exposure in children.",
                "who_can_participate": "HIV+ children aged between 6-18 years ",
                "study_involves": " Children participating in the study are randomized by age (6 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years) and region (Africa vs non Africa). In each randomised arm, at least 70 children by age group are included.  Those in group 1 receive the NRTI-sparing regimen - dolutegravir + darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) (DUAL). Those in group 2 receive the usual standard of care (triple anti-retroviral therapy including 2 NRTIs + boosted PI/NNRTI) (TRIPLE). All participants are followed until the last patient recruited reaches week 48. The period of recruitment is 72 weeks.",
                "benefits_risks": " As the study medicines only need to be taken once a day, it is expected that participants will find it easier to remember to take their medicines and suffer fewer long term side-effects. Possible disadvantages include the participants having to take more trips to the clinic, and, for patients in group 1, taking Prezista and dolutegravir together with the low dose of Norvir will not be as effective as their usual medicine at keeping the level of virus low. Side effects not previously experienced could also occur such as headache, tummy pain, nausea, rash, cough or insomnia.",

                "background_study_aims": "Malaria in Indonesia is a substantial problem with approximately 35% of the population at risk and 10-14% of pregnant women being infected with malaria at any time.  Pregnant women are a vulnerable group and both P.falciparum and P.vivax infections contribute to adverse effects of malaria in pregnancy. If you contract malaria during your pregnancy you can have devastating consequences resulting in fever which may trigger preterm labour or pregnancy loss. It is also possible for you to be infected without showing any outward signs or symptoms of malaria, yet if these infections are undetected and left untreated, they can cause anaemia in the mother and can interfere with the growth of the fetus leading to low birth weight, which increases the risk of babies dying during infancy.",
                "who_can_participate": " Women between 16-30 weeks of gestation with a viable pregnancy at antenatal visit and residing in the study area will be eligible to join the study. ",
                "study_involves": " The study will use three intervention methods to assess whether malaria infections in pregnancy and adverse effects associated with it can be reduced. One intervention will provide malaria testing to women with or without the symptoms of malaria at every scheduled antenatal visit. A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) will be used. The RDT is simple to perform, uses a single drop of blood and gives results within 15 minutes. If you test positive for malaria you will be treated with an artemisinin combination drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), which is the treatment of choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy in Indonesia. This method is called intermittent screening and treatment for prevention of malaria in pregnancy (ISTp). A second method called intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp), which is used in most countries in Africa but not yet in Asia, will also be tested. With this method pregnant women regardless of malaria symptoms will be selected to receive the same drug but without prior blood testing. These new methods will be compared with the existing policy in Indonesia, where all pregnant women are tested for malaria at the first antenatal visit only, and those with a positive result are treated with DHP in second and third trimester and with quinine in first trimester. During subsequent antenatal visits, women are tested only if they have symptoms of malaria such as fever. This means that some infections will go undetected. It is anticipated that the two new methods will either detect infections much earlier than the current approach, or prevent malaria altogether.",
                "benefits_risks": " DHP is a very effective treatment for malaria in pregnancy. Experience in previous studies of more than 1200 pregnancies treated with DHP in second and third trimester found it a safe drug for the baby.  However we will carefully monitor all babies born to the women in the study to see if the drug has any adverse effect on the pregnant or her baby. The findings of this study, together with an assessment of feasibility and cost effectiveness of each of the method stated above, will be used to inform malaria prevention policy for pregnant women in Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia. Those participating in the study will be tested for anaemia and malaria and receive free treatment for these conditions. Transport cost to attend antenatal care will be provided and every woman will receive a long lasting insecticide treated bed net at the time of enrolment. Participants will be followed from recruitment until 8 weeks after delivery.",

                "background_study_aims": "The RISAPS trial follows on from the RAPS (Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome) study that showed that rivaroxaban offers an effective alternative to warfarin for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who have thrombosis (blood clots) in their veins, rather than in their arteries and require standard intensity anticoagulation (blood thinning). Currently, APS patients who have had an ischaemic stroke (which occurs when blood flow to an area of brain is cut off) are treated with warfarin to reduce the risk of a recurrence. Warfarin tends to have a variable ‘blood thinning’ effect in patients with APS, requiring frequent (usually weekly) blood tests to monitor the effect of the warfarin, which is inconvenient for patients and affects their quality of life. The RISAPS trial will compare higher intensity (higher dose) rivaroxaban versus higher intensity warfarin (current standard of care treatment) for 24 months, in APS patients, with or without lupus, requiring higher intensity anticoagulation after experiencing a stroke, a 'mini stroke' (also known as a transient ischaemic attack), or other ischaemic brain damage (caused by blood clots in the brain arteries or smaller blood vessels). Rivaroxaban, unlike warfarin, does not require regular blood tests, because it has a more predictable blood thinning effect. Furthermore, rivaroxaban does not interact with food or alcohol and has fewer interactions with other drugs. If rivaroxaban is no worse than warfarin for anticoagulation of APS patients with stroke, it could become the standard of care for the treatment of APS patients, with or without lupus, who have experienced stroke or other ischaemic brain damage and improve patients' quality of life. The more predictable blood thinning effect of rivaroxaban may also be associated with a lower risk of bleeding and thrombosis than in patients on warfarin. ",

They believe that this would provide sufficient supporting data to change practice for patients, i.e. to make rivaroxaban the standard of care for the treatment of APS patients, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), who have stroke or other ischaemic brain manifestations.",

                "background_study_aims": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is an increasingly common problem in our aging society. In the UK an estimated 8.5 million people are affected by OA, causing an enormous burden to health authorities, as well as considerable pain and disability to these individuals. A recent study by Arthritis Care reported that 81% of people with OA experience constant pain and 72% have important related conditions, such as high blood pressure or depression. Current treatments for knee OA are limited as they often only work for short periods and are not effective for all patients. As a result people with OA often live with severe pain and have significant difficulty in carrying out their normal day-to-day activities. There is therefore an urgent need to find new and better ways to manage pain for people with OA. Methotrexate has been used very successfully to treat inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, and it is now the drug used most often to treat that type of arthritis. Recent studies suggest that inflammation is also important in OA, and that by reducing inflammation, pain will also be reduced. The aim of this study is to find out whether methotrexate is an effective treatment for reducing inflammation in knee OA and whether this leads to a reduction in pain.",

                "background_study_aims": " Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling and progressive neurological disease that affects about 100,000 people in the UK. Many patients with MS experience two phases of disease: early MS (also called relapsing remitting MS, RRMS) and late MS (also called secondary progressive MS or SPMS). Early MS is due to inflammation of the nerves and the insulation (called myelin) that surrounds the nerves. Early MS is often characterised by periods of 'attacks' interspersed with periods of 'remission' with no or low disease symptoms. Late or progressive MS, which affects the majority of patients and typically emerges after 10-15 years of disease, results from actual nerve death (also called neurodegeneration). The progressive stage of disease results not in individual attacks but slow, cumulative and irreversible disability affecting walking, balance, vision, cognition, pain control, bladder and bowel function. Critically, and unlike early disease, there is no proven treatment for the late stage of MS. This is therefore an urgent and major unmet health need. This study directly addresses this need and will evaluate three drugs (fluoxetine, riluzole and amiloride), all of which have shown some promise in MS, and in particular in SPMS.",

                "acronym": "MS-SMART",
                "study_hypothesis": "The general aim is to determine the efficacy, and advance our understanding of the mechanism of action, of three putative neuroprotective repurposed drugs (fluoxetine, riluzole and amiloride) versus placebo, through MRI, disability measurement, OCT and targeted CSF analysis.Hypothesis:Drugs that target key neurodegeneration-causing pathways in MS will be neuroprotective as demonstrated by slowing the rate of brain volume loss in people with SPMS.Aims:Primary: to test against placebo, the efficacy of fluoxetine, riluzole and amiloride in SPMS over a two year period.Secondary: to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of efficacy, noting that each drug targets distinct and key disease related mechanistic pathways. Multiple sclerosis is the commonest disabling neurological disease affecting young adults in temperate latitudes. It is a progressive disorder of the brain and spinal cord. Many patients with MS experience two phases of disease: (i) early MS (relapsing remitting MS) and (ii) late MS, secondary progressive MS (SPMS), affecting the majority of patients after 10-15 years. SPMS results from nerve death that causes accumulating and irreversible disability. There is no proven treatment for SPMS and it is a major unmet health need for the NHS. These patients require nerve protection treatments that will slow, stop and ultimately reverse progressive disease. A systematic review of all relevant pre-clinical and clinical data by the MS Clinical Trials Network and an international MS expert workshop led to the identification of three leading drugs (fluoxetine, riluzole or amiloride) suitable to trial in SPMS. The MS-SMART trial will test these drugs in 440 SPMS patients using a simultaneous multi-arm trial design, each compared against a dummy drug (placebo). Patients will be on the trial for up to week 100 (approximately 25 months) and will be recruited from specialist centres within the UK. Patients and treating trial clinician will not know which drug they are receiving to enable an unbiased testing of the drugs. All patients will have MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans and after 96 weeks these will be analysed to determine which drugs are the most promising. The main (primary) outcome is change in MRI, to see if any of the drugs can slow the rate of brain shrinkage that we would normally see in SPMS, supported by lesion and disability changes, compared to being on the dummy drug. This trial is a world-first in MS, with great economies of scale.

                "background_study_aims": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that damages the cells in the immune system and weakens the body’s ability to fight everyday infections and disease. HIV is treated with antiretroviral medications which stop the virus replicating in the body. In 2014, an estimated 823,000 HIV-infected children and adolescents aged up to 15 years were receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries. From 2015, World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines recommended all HIV-infected adults and children take ART, regardless of the strength of their immune system (CD4 count) or their clinical status. The numbers of HIV-infected children on first-line ART in low-income countries is therefore likely to continue to increase, despite reductions in many countries of new infections through mother-to child transmission. The growing number of children on ART, coupled with increased detection of ART treatment failure, will increase the number of children needing to switch from their first ART drug treatment (first line) to second-line treatment. This raises the question of whether current second-line ART is optimal in terms of maximising children’s health gains and minimising toxicity (side effects) from the treatment long-term, given the need for children to receive life-long ART. The current WHO-recommended second-line ART for children failing standard first-line treatment is not ideal, as it is based on a fixed dose combination drug which needs to be taken as whole (non-crushed) pills, mini-pill pellets or unpalatable liquid, and also interacts with anti-tuberculosis drugs. The aim of this study is to optimise second-line treatment in HIV-infected children by testing new antiretroviral drugs/formulations, in order to maximise long-term health gains.",

Participants are then randomly allocated to one ‘third-drug’ and one ‘NRTI based regimen’.The four ‘third-drug’ options are:1. The current standard of care, called lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)2. A different drug which belongs to the same family as LPV/r, called atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r). This drug is used a lot in adults but has not previously been available as a single pill for children3. A different drug that also belongs to the same drug family as LPV/r, called darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r)4. A drug which belongs to a different family, called dolutegravir (DTG)The two ‘NRTI based regimens’ are:1. The current standard of care, which is lamivudine (3TC) combined with whichever of abacavir (ABC) or zidovudine (ZDV) is not taken as first-line ART2. A new drug called‘TAF (tenofovir alafenamide) combined with a drug very similar to lamivudine called emtricitabine (FTC). TAF is a new type of an existing ART drug called tenofovir which is much kinder on people’s bones and kidneys and so can be tested in childrenEnough ART is prescribed for the participant to take daily until they are seen at their next clinic visit. Participants are followed up for 2 years with clinic visits every 3 months. At the visits side effects and responses to treatment are carefully checked by a nurse and a doctor. A small amount of blood is collected and stored at each visit. The first children enrolled into the study, plus children who receive anti- tuberculosis treatment during the study have additional blood tests to look at levels of the antiretroviral drugs in their blood.",

However, the information from this study will help to improve treatment for children with HIV in the future. These children need to be treated with second-line ART regardless of whether or not they participate in the study, and all treatment has risks and side effects. The common side effects of ART are stomach upsets, changes in the liver, problems with kidney and bones, difficulty sleeping, hypersensitivity reactions and tiredness.

DRV/r will provide superior virological suppression 96 weeks after starting second-line ART compared to second-line ART based on the bPIs LPV/r or ATV/r3.

Eventually, patients can develop liver failure and liver cancer. There are slightly different types of the hepatitis C in different places around the world. In Vietnam, the most common types are called genotype 1 and genotype 6. Recently, there has been great progress in improving treatment of hepatitis C because of the development of drugs called DAAs (direct acting antivirals). DAAs can cure hepatitis C in the vast majority of patients, which is defined as HCV can no longer being detected in the patient’s blood. It is thought that when the virus is no longer detectable in blood, then the patient is no longer at risk of liver failure or cancer. However, DAAs have not been used much in patients with infections caused genotype 6 HCV. Because genotype 6 infections are common in Vietnam, it is important to make sure that these new DAAs work in Vietnam.One of the problems with HCV treatment is that the medication needs to be taken every day for 12 weeks. However, it is likely that shorter courses of treatment, that would be easier for patients to complete, are just as effective. This study aims to improve treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by testing whether shorter courses of treatment are effective in some patients, and to show that this treatment also works in Vietnam.

At each visit the patient will see the study doctors who will assess the patients response to treatment and perform any blood tests needed for the study. This will include blood tests to measure the amount of HCV in the blood, and the amount of DAA drugs in the blood.In this study, we will enroll 2 kinds of patients – those with mild HCV infections (no evidence of liver damage yet), and those with cirrhosis (evidence of liver scarring due to the HCV infection).In the first group of patients, we will measure the amount of HCV in their blood 48 hours after starting treatment. Patients who do not have any HCV detectable in their blood at this timepoint will have shortened treatment and will continue their DAA treatment until 4 (rather than the usual 12) weeks treatment has been completed. The patients will be followed up in clinic in line with standard practice to ensure they remain cured. If they are not cured they will be offered re-treatment with 12 weeks of treatment.For the second group of patients, we will measure the amount of HCV in their blood 14 days after starting treatment. Patients who do not have any HCV detectable in their blood at this timepoint will continue their DAA treatment until 12 (rather than the usual 24) weeks treatment has been completed. The patients will be followed up in clinic in line with standard practice to ensure they remain cured. If they are not cured they will be offered re-treatment with 24 weeks of treatment.",
                "benefits_risks": "The benefits of participating in the study are that all treatment and monitoring will be provided free for the participants, including compensation for travel costs for attending the study. The treatment is likely to cure the patients of HCV, but there may be a small risk of lower overall cure rates in patients who receive shorter treatment courses. Therefore, if a patient received shortened treatment because of a good initial response, but then did not clear the HCV from their blood, they will be offered free retreatment for 12 (mild cases) or 24 (cirrhosis) weeks. Being in the study will result in some additional blood tests. Blood tests are taken using a need from a vein in the arm and this can be uncomfortable and occasionally result in bruising.",

Each participant in the two arms will be treated with the same drug combination (sofosbuvir (SOF) 400mg and daclatasvir (DCV) 60mg orally, taken daily), but with differing durations of therapy. The duration of first-line SOF/DCV treatment will be determined by the initial response to treatment.For mild liver disease arm, all individuals will have their HCV RNA load assayed at enrolment and 24 and 48 hours after initiation of therapy (first dose to be taken in the clinic at day 0). For participants with viral load <500 IU/ml at 48 hours (day 2 visit), treatment will be complete 4 weeks of therapy. All other participants will receive 8 weeks of therapy. Following cessation of first line therapy (at the end of treatment (EOT) visit), all participants will have HCV viral load assayed twice weekly for 4 weeks. Participants meeting the definitions of first line failure will be eligible for retreatment with the same drug combination for 12 weeks at any time after EOT +2 weeks.For the arm consisting of patients with compensated cirrhosis, participants who have achieved virological suppression (HCV RNA load <500 IU/ml) by 14 days after initiating treatment will complete 12 weeks of therapy. Those who do not achieve virological suppression will continue to complete 24 weeks of therapy. Following completion of first line therapy, all participants will have HCV viral load assayed every four weeks for 12 weeks.The study follow-up completes at 12 weeks after the end of treatment, or re-treatment, for all patients.

The flour breads from the grinding of the whole grain, made into yeast dough, produces a low glycemic index, because its starch is digested slowly. In addition, repeatedly low postprandial insulinemia can be an indicator of insulin sensibility, and therefore, in metabolic syndrome pathology, it can reflect an improvement of the existent insulin resistance and low grade inflammation. In addition, these artisanal breads can induce a greater satiety state in comparison with the short fermentation ones. In this regard, the low carbohydrate content in long fermentation bread, with respect to the industrial one of short fermentation, is compensated by the high fat content, which produces the energy value similar between both breads.",

We will also evaluate the symptoms (hunger, fullness, nausea, swelling, and pain), during and 30 and 60 min after completing the intake using 100 mm visual analogue scales. The satiety test will be carried out at study baseline and 8 weeks after intervention.10. Satiety markers (endocannabinoids) will be determined at baseline and 1 h after the intake of Ensure11. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, neuropeptides, and satiety hormones (insulin, ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1, PYY, glycagon) will be measured in blood samples obtained at fasting (20 ml) and at 10 min (10 ml), 20 min (10 ml), 30 min (10 ml) and at the end of the test (10 ml)",

Patients will also be asked to complete a short Quality of Life questionnaire which has been developed specifically for patients with MPNs.Once registered to the study, patients will have a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with tamoxifen at 20mg od as an oral tablet.Patients will be seen 2 weeks after starting treatment for blood tests and a medical exam and then again at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24. At weeks 12 and 24 they will also have a blood sample taken for central review at Cambridge and a full fasting lipid profile. At week 24, the patient will also be asked to have a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy and complete the same Quality of Life Questionnaire they completed at baseline. If the patient had an enlarged spleen on the baseline ultrasound, an ultrasound may be repeated at any point during the 24 weeks if the blood counts suggest the patient is in Complete Response.If the patient continues trial therapy beyond 24 weeks, they will be seen a minimum of 12 weekly for blood tests and a medical exam.Patients will also be required to attend their local hospital 28 days after the final dose of tamoxifen for blood tests and a medical exam.",

                "background_study_aims": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a relapsing and remitting autoimmune disease. Whilst a considerable amount is understood about factors which may contribute to the development of RA and about disease mechanisms, nothing is known of the factors that trigger disease relapses (flares), converting the disease from an inactive to an active state.  The underpinning mechanism(s) of flare has been difficult to study because they occur unpredictably. The researchers will study patients who flare to capture signals that may determine which patients are most likely to flare, as well as understand the biology behind the phenomenon of flare itself.  This may eventually lead to future work on treatable targets in disease management.",
                "who_can_participate": "Patients in remission from RA on traditional disease-modifying therapies (DMARDs), namely methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and/or hydroxychloroquine",
                "study_involves": "The patients stop taking their DMARDs and are closely followed-up by the research team. Previous research suggests 50% will experience flare, while the remainder will remain in remission.  They have regular assessment of their disease activity (physical examination and questionnaires), along with clinical and research blood samples taken. Urine samples are taken at each visit.  If a patient in the study experiences a flare, they have an ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy taken under local anaesthetic.  Samples of blood, urine and synovium (joint lining) are analysed for gene expression, synovial cell subtypes, molecular pathways, immune cell profiles, and antibody status. After 6 months, if a patient does not experience a flare, they are referred back to their usual rheumatologist and may be able to remain off of DMARDs.  If a patient experiences flare at any time, they receive steroid treatment and be referred back to their usual rheumatologist to restart their DMARDs.",
                "benefits_risks": "Based on previous research performed at other centres and our own, it is expect that up to half of the patients with RA in remission may be able to stop their DMARD medication without an increase in their arthritis activity.  DMARD medications have an associated small risk of serious side effects. By participating in this study patients will be helping to provide important data that may help to identify markers that can predict when, how and which people with RA will flare. While it may not necessarily be of direct benefit to the participant, it is hoped that this study will help us to understand more about rheumatoid arthritis, how it develops and what treatments will be effective. There is a risk that when patients stop taking their DMARD medication their arthritis may become more active, causing joint pain and swelling. It is difficult to predict the exact chance of this happening, but previous studies suggest that this may occur in around half of the patients. Patients who experience disease activity will be seen at short notice to confirm, before being referred rapidly back to their rheumatology team who would be able to restart DMARD medications. A steroid injection/course of steroid tablets may also be offered to help settle the arthritis",

The researchers will be using conventional fluorescence-based flow cytometry and also mass cytometry (CyTOF) to measure the immune cell subsets, specifically the T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and monocytes. This will be done in batches to reduce batch effect and cytometer drift. All of the samples from one patient will be analysed at a single timepoint (following stabilisation and freezing of the samples)3. Autoantibody profiles. The researchers will transfer serum samples to their industrial partner Orgentec for assessment of antibody specificity. Antigen affinity of key autoantibodies will be measured using BIACORE surface plasmon resonance or similar techniques. Circulating cytokines will be measured in serum and/or plasma using immunoassays or ELISAs4. Epigenetic profiles: high-order chromatin structures in immune cells, such as PBMC, CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes, will be evaluated on the EpiSwitchTM PCR platform (in partnership with Oxford Biodynamics). Differentiating signatures will be refined using binary EpiswitchTM scores and logistical regression modelling, and the accuracy and robustness of the predictive model determined by ROC analysis.5.

Before each vaccination physical examination, laboratory tests (White Blood Cell [WBC] count, differential blood count, kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, CRP, LDH, coagulation tests and urine analysis) were performed. To detect autoimmune reactions, we measured Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), free Triiodothyronine (fT3), free Thyroxine (fT4), as well as Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), CRP and Blood Sedimentation rate (BSG). 2. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and Granzyme B Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISpot) assays: IFN-gamma and granzyme B ELISpot assays were performed as previously described to determine specific lysis of RHAMM (peptide) positive target cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD, San Diego, USA). We participated in an inter-laboratory test for ELISpot assays.3. Tetramer staining:The frequency of R3 specific CD8+ T lymphocytes was determined after eight days Mixed Lymphocyte Peptide Culture (MLPC) by staining with anti-CD8 antibody and HLA-A2/R3 tetramer R-Phycoerythrin (PE). HLA-A2/R3 tetramer PE was synthesised at the Lausanne Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. CD8+ T lymphocytes (0.5 - 1 x 10^6) stimulated with irradiated CD8- Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) in the presence of the R3 peptide were stained with HLA-A2/R3 tetramer PE 1 µg per test with respect to the peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I component in the dark and incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. Thereafter, for four-color staining, 10 µl CD8 Peridinin Chlorophyll Protein (PerCP), 10 µl CD45RA Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) and 4 µl CCR7 APC (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) were added at 4°C for 20 minutes in the dark. As for six-color staining, the cells were stained with 1 µg HLA-A2/R3 tetramer PE and HLA-A2/WT1 tetramer PerCP per test with respect to the peptide-MHC class I component in the dark and incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. Thereafter 5 µl CD8 APC-Cy7, 5 µl CD45RA APC (Invitrogen, Caltag, CA, USA), 10 µl CCR7 PE-Cy7, 10 µl CD27 FITC or CD28 FITC (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) were added at 4°C for 20 minutes in the dark. After washing once with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), stained cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma, Germany) and then analysed by flow cytometry. Whenever possible, at least 100,000 events were collected for analysis. Each sample was run with an appropriate isotype control to define the gate of positive cells. Analysis was performed on tightly gated lymphocytes to exclude dead cells and debris and on CD8+ T lymphocytes to evaluate responses to R3 peptide. Samples were defined as \"tetramer positive\" in case of an increase of specific R3-tetramer+/CD8+ T cells of more than 50% (if initial count was = 0.1%), or 25% increase (if initial count was greater than 0.1%). We participated in an inter-laboratory test for tetramer flow cytometry assays.",

It can be serious disease if it is not treated quickly and effectively. One type, called vivax malaria, can hide in the liver and reenter the blood to cause repeated illness (relapse). Repeated relapse is particularly damaging to the health and development of children. The usual medicines given for vivax malaria can only kill the parasites in the blood. There is one medicine, called primaquine, which can be taken to kill the vivax malaria parasite in the liver and so will reduce the risk of relapses. Some individuals may have weak red cells. Red cells need enzymes to work properly and weak red cells have low amounts of an enzyme called glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). People with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) can be at risk if they take primaquine because it can destroy their red cells. This study aims to find out how best to use primaquine in patients with normal or weak (G6PD deficient) red cells so that we can introduce better treatments for vivax malaria around the world. ",

Those in the second group receive seven days treatment of high dose primaquine followed by seven days of placebo (dummy pill). Those in the third group receive 14 days treatment with a placebo (dummy pill). Patients in all groups are followed up daily for two weeks, then weekly until week 8, and then monthly until 12 months to see if their malaria has come back.",

Patients also receive the results of their G6PD test which can be useful to them if they need malaria treatment in the future.

                "background_study_aims": "Some of the drugs used to treat HIV (anti-retrovirals) can affect the blood levels of other drugs used to treat tuberculosis (TB) – called a drug-drug interaction. The main drug used in second-line HIV treatment, Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir), is one of the drugs that has this effect. This is why people on second-line anti-retrovirals usually cannot use one of the main TB drugs, rifampicin, and instead will be prescribed a slightly different drug called rifabutin, which is less affected by these drug-drug interactions. Although blood levels of rifabutin are not as badly affected by Aluvia as blood levels of rifampicin, rifabutin blood levels are still increased a lot by taking Aluvia at the same time. This could lead to higher levels of side-effects because there is more of the drug in the body. Doctors have suggested that instead of taking rifabutin every day with Aluvia, it should only be taken three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. However, in the last 2 years, new studies have suggested that this three times a week regimen might not be enough and that it may not completely cure TB. So the purpose of this study is to find out whether taking rifabutin every day with Aluvia really does lead to more side-effects, and whether taking rifabutin three times a week with Aluvia really does lead to much lower levels of rifabutin in the blood.",

To record the tolerance of the therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin over 72 weeks inclusive the adverse reactions and the withdrawal rates.2. To evaluate the biochemical response to the treatment (Alanine Aminotransferase [ALT] values during and after the therapy) in comparison to the virological response to the treatment.3. To evaluate the validity of the withdrawal rules of this trial at week 12 and 24 in comparison to the two-log-rule and a qualitative detection of the HCV RNA at week 24 with a detection limit of 50 IU/ml.4. To evaluate the impact of the HCV RNA concentration before the therapy, and the HCV kinetic during the therapy on the response to the treatment in the different groups.5.

                "background_study_aims": "Recent studies have suggested that some HIV-infected patients experience mild problems with 'cognitive impairment'.  Mild cognitive impairment means a slight slowing of brain processes, which could lead to problems with memory or concentration.  Currently it is not fully understood why these problems occur or what we may be able to do to improve them.  In particular it is not known what role anti-retroviral medications (anti-HIV drugs) may have in affecting brain function, and whether certain anti-retroviral drugs may lead to a greater tendency to develop problems, or whether some may be better than others at preventing the problems. Efavirenz (EFV) is currently one of the most commonly used anti-retroviral drugs.  It is also known as Sustiva® and is a component of Atripla®.  We know that Efavirenz can have effects on the brain in the first few weeks of treatment such as bad dreams and dizziness, but these usually settle.  However, recent research suggests that Efavirenz may have some longer term effect on brain function (although this does not appear to be very severe in the vast majority of cases). This study aims to find out whether switching treatment away from Efavirenz to another anti-retroviral medication (Kaletra®) may improve brain function. Kaletra® is another commonly used anti-retroviral medication and does not appear to have the same potential effect on brain function.  ",

                "study_involves": " We will switch your medication from Efavirenz to Kaletra® for 12 weeks, and look for any change in brain function. We will make measurements at the beginning and end of the study to see how they change. These will include: a special kind of MRI scan, which measures chemicals in the brain, a computerised test of brain function ('memory games'), sleep diaries and blood tests. If impairment in brain function is due to Efavirenz use, this may change and possibly improve on switching to Kaletra.  This is a pilot study and therefore any changes seen would need to be confirmed in further studies.  There is a possibility that there will be no significant changes and no improvement or change in brain function that is detectable.",
                "benefits_risks": " The main purpose of the study is to better understand the effect of different anti-retroviral drugs on brain function in HIV infection to help clinicians guide treatment choices in the future.  It is possible that patients may see an improvement in their cognitive function (e.g. memory or concentration) and quality of sleep; however, this may not be solely due to the study drug. Both Efavirenz and Kaletra® are licensed for treatment of HIV infection and they are considered to be equally effective.  There is therefore a negligible risk of virological failure (rise in HIV viral load) from a switch to Kaletra®.  Patients viral load will be monitored for any problems during the study. Kaletra® is a commonly used anti-retroviral medication and has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in large clinical trials.  There are possible side effects associated with taking Kaletra®; these include nausea and a slightly higher rate of diarrhoea compared with Efavirenz.  If these do occur they are usually mild.  The rate of serious adverse events with Kaletra has been shown to be low.  Some patients also show increases in levels of cholesterol and triglycerides on their blood tests.  These changes would not be expected to lead to any problems within the short duration of this study.  The blood tests will be monitored regularly to check for any problems during the study.  ",

This means that there may be slight slowing of brain processes and this may lead to problems with memory or concentration.

                "background_study_aims": " Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is believed to affect more than 14 million people in Europe and North America and is the leading cause of visual impairment in the UK. Currently there are no treatments for early AMD or for the advanced form of the disease called geographic atrophy (GA). The other advanced form of the disease is known as wet or neovascular AMD, and may be treated by injecting a drug called Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) into the eye. The causes of AMD are not yet fully understood but it has been linked to an insufficient supply of oxygen (hypoxia) to the retina at the back of the eye. The demand of oxygen by the retina is greatest at night, so this is when hypoxia is likely to have its strongest effect.  By exposing the eye to dim light at night this hypoxia is reduced. In practice this involves wearing a light mask at night that emits a dim green light. The light mask is CE marked for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This study aim to find out if such a mask can also be used to slow the progression of AMD. As this is the first time this approach has been used to treat people with AMD, another main aim of the study is to assess the safety of this treatment. ",
                "who_can_participate": " Sixty volunteers, between 55 and 88 years of age, will be recruited from hospital AMD Clinics. They will have early AMD in one eye and wet AMD in the fellow eye. Participants will be recruited at the end of the first 3 months of Lucentis ® treatment. An additional study (called a cross sectional study) will also recruit 40 people in the same age-group who have no signs of AMD, or only early changes. ",
                "study_involves": " At the start of the study, each participant will attend an appointment with the study researcher who will carry out a number of eye and vision tests. Then, half of the volunteers will be allocated by chance to a 'treatment' group, and will be given a light mask to wear every night for a year, whilst the other half will be allocated to a 'control' group which will not receive a light mask. Both groups will continue to receive their Lucentis® injections as usual. At each monthly check-up at the AMD clinic, participants in both groups will be invited to attend a brief meeting with the study researcher to discuss how they are getting on with the mask (if applicable), to have the mask replaced when necessary (every 3 months), and to answer some questions about their sleep patterns. At the end of the study (after 12 months) each participant will be invited back so we can repeat the clinical tests which were carried out at the beginning of the trial. ",
                "benefits_risks": " If it is found to be effective, this therapy could slow or stop the progression of AMD.  As this is the first study of its kind, a larger study with more participants will need to be carried out in the future to confirm the results. All people who are found to be suitable and are enrolled in the study will receive a complimentary £10 gift voucher. Low-level night-time light therapy has been shown to be safe. However, because this is the first study in people with AMD, safety will be a priority in this study. One possible side effect is that the light at night may disrupt sleep. Whilst this has not been a problem reported in studies of the light mask in people with diabetic retinopathy, we will monitor sleep patterns by asking each participant questions from a sleep quality questionnaire each month. We will also look at photographs taken of the retinas at the AMD clinic each month, to ensure that there are no signs that the mask is causing any damage to the eyes. ",

                "background_study_aims": "Ebola virus disease is a serious illness caused by the Ebola virus. The virus originated in Africa and is particularly common in West Africa, where there is currently a serious outbreak. A person infected with Ebola will usually develop a fever, headache and muscle pain/weakness, but if left untreated, it could lead to serious gastrointestinal (gut) symptoms, impaired kidney and live function, internal bleeding and even death. To date, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease. Interferon-β (interferon-beta) is a broad spectrum (general) antiviral medication that has shown limited activity against the Ebola virus in laboratory experiments on cells and animals. Given the severity of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a study has been designed to test Interferon-β on people with Ebola virus disease in Guinea (West Africa). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Interferon-β in the treatment of patients with Ebola virus disease.",

Participants have a sample of blood taken at the start of the study and then after 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13 and 15 days to test the level of the virus present in the body. Participants are also monitored in order to record any negative side effects they get from the medication.",

When light enters the eye, the cells that make up the retina convert the light rays into electrical impulses, which travel via the optic nerve into the brain so they can be interpreted as images. Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death or “cellular suicide”. DARC Technology (Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells) is a new technique that uses the unique properties of the eye to make it possible to view nerve cells in the eye dying via optosis. The technique uses a substance called ANX776, which has previously been shown to be well tolerated in patients and cause minimal side effects. The aim of this study is to further evaluate the extent to which it is possible to see apoptosis in retinal cells in patients with a range of long-term eye diseases and healthy people of the same age.",

The main risks are discomfort during the eye examination, or discomfort caused by bright, flashing lights. One of the tests is an intra-ocular pressure measurement (which measures the pressure inside the eye). There is a very small chance of getting a scratch on the surface of the eye during this test. If this does happen, it should heal on its own. The trial involves eye numbing drops which in rare cases may cause an allergic reaction, difficulty in breathing or low blood pressure.

After giving fully informed consent, patients will be subjected to a medical history and physical examination to document general fitness to proceed with the trial. Previous exposure to small pox vaccine will be noted. The diagnosis should be confirmed histologically from the patient's records. If possible, a retained sample will be obtained to stain for 5T4. If a fresh sample is taken, it may be cryopreserved and also examined for 5T4. At that time, metastases will be documented using relevant CT scans (chest, abdomen, pelvic). An MRI scan of the brain will be obtained. A cardiac stress test and pulmonary function tests will be obtained in appropriate patients.Blood will also be drawn for haematology and clinical chemistry, full blood count with differential white cell and platelet counts, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests (total bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase), serum proteins, calcium, phosphate, glucose and creatinine), pituitary hormone screen (ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH), antinuclear and anti-skeletal muscle antibodies and immunological testing (antibodies to 5T4 and vector, cellular responses to 5T4; 100 ml). In potentially fertile women, a pregnancy test will be obtained. A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood. This screen should not occur more than two weeks before the immunisation schedule begins.At week 0, the patients will be immunised with a single intramuscular injection of 1 ml of TroVax® 10x. This dose will be given without IL-2. Then, every three to four weeks for four injections, TroVax® will be given in the morning. These doses may be given in conjunction with IL-2. Immediately before each injection, blood will be drawn for immunological testing (100 ml). Before the injection, blood will also be drawn for clinical pathology (full blood count and clinical chemistry). A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood.IL-2 will be given intravenously (IV) in a dose of 600,000 IU/kg every eight hours for up to 15 injections in each cycle. The first dose will be given in the afternoon of the same day as the second TroVax® injection. These cycles of TroVax® and IL-2 will be repeated every 3-4 weeks depending upon patient tolerance and clinical response. Cycles of IL-2 will always commence in the afternoon after TroVax® has been given in the morning. If IL-2 is not tolerated, it may be suspended but treatment with TroVax® will be continued so long as it is well tolerated. TroVax® may be given for up to three months (i.e. injection 5) to patients with progressive disease so long as no other anticancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy, interferon alpha or radiotherapy) is considered indicated for them.CT scans (chest abdomen, pelvis) will be obtained to restage the disease at weeks 9-10 and 15-16 (i.e. after two and four doses of IL-2 and/or 3 and 5 doses of TroVax®).A blood sample for immunological testing (100 ml) will be obtained three and eight weeks after the fifth TroVax® injection (4 and 5 months).Following the CT scan at 15-16 weeks patients will be followed at three monthly intervals, commencing at six months. Patients whose disease is progressing at this point may not be treated further with TroVax® but may be kept on study and observed at three monthly intervals. Patients whose disease has stabilised or responded will be offered three further injections of TroVax® at months 6, 9 and 12. Patients whose disease progresses or who experience serious or severe adverse events related to TroVax® will stop treatment with TroVax® but may be kept on study and reviewed at three monthly intervals.

A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood. The disease will be restaged using CT scans (chest abdomen, pelvis).When TroVax® is being administered, patients will return 3 weeks after each TroVax® injection for immunological testing (100 ml).After month 12, patients will return at three monthly intervals for a further 12 months. At each visit, the disease will be restaged using CT scans (chest abdomen, pelvis) in accordance with current institutional guidelines. Blood (100 ml) will be obtained for immunological testing, autoantibodies and pituitary function tests. A urine sample will be obtained for urinalysis for protein and blood.

                "study_hypothesis": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous group of conditions with a disturbed integrity of articular cartilage and changes in the underlying bone. The pathogenesis of OA is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay of genetic, metabolic, biochemical, and biomechanical factors with variable components of inflammation. The disease, as one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases, leads to pain in and around the affected joints and to swelling, stiffness, deformity, and gradual loss of function. It is not just a disease of elderly people, but also affects the younger working age population. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that in clinical practice is also used for inflammatory OA and has been employed for the treatment of various rheumatic and dermatologic diseases. Current research has further enhanced our understanding of the pharmacologic mechanisms of action of these drugs involving inhibition of endosomal toll - like receptor (TLR) signalling, which limits B cells and dendritic cell activation. Three studies of HCQ in OA, including one abstract and one letter are available. Most studies show that currently a wide variety of outcome measures are used in rather small patient populations.Despite initial indications for a good effect of HCQ, there has been no randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in a larger patient group. In the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) evidence based recommendations for the management of hand OA HCQ was not included as a therapeutic option, apparently because of the currently missing randomized clinical trials. The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the efficacy of HCQ by clinical and radiological outcome compared to placebo in patients with severe and refractory inflammatory hand OA.",

                "background_study_aims": "Chickenpox and herpes zoster are common infections that may be particularly severe in children with a suppressed immune system. It has been shown that vaccination with a live-virus chickenpox vaccine in children with cancer, HIV and after transplantation is very safe and effective. Most current guidelines, however, prevent children receiving intensive immunosuppressive treatment from live-virus vaccination due to concerns about safety and effectiveness. Current guidelines focus on the type of medication the patients are receiving. However, this is problematic since there is a growing number of antirheumatic medications and it is impossible to test the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in all of them. Therefore, in many countries, there is a large number of children with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive treatment who are at risk for severe chickenpox or herpes zoster. Children with rheumatic diseases often receive medications to suppress the immune system. It is suspected, however, that most children with rheumatic diseases on intensive immunosuppressive treatment may safely receive the chickenpox vaccine. A checklist has been developed to check the immune reaction of patients independent of the type of immunosuppressive treatment. The aim of this study is to find out whether children can be safely immunized after using this checklist.",

The safety of the vaccine is assessed by determining whether side effects have occurred, including flares of the rheumatic diseases, by sending out a questionnaire to the participants’ families within 12 weeks after vaccination. Regarding effectiveness, serum varicella zoster virus IgG (antibody) levels are measured within 4 to 12 weeks after vaccination. Participants are also interviewed after a longer period of time (3 years) to determine whether cases of chickenpox or herpes zoster, both causes by varicella zoster virus, have occurred.",
                "benefits_risks": "The possible benefits include protection against varicella zoster virus infection, a potential cause for severe disease among immunosuppressed patients. The possible risks include exposure to two vaccinations which may cause brief injection site reactions and may be less effective compared to people who are not immunosuppressed.

                "background_study_aims": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a type of virus known as a retrovirus. HIV attacks and weakens the immune system, making it more difficult for a sufferer to fight infections. It is a highly contagious disease, through bodily fluids such as blood, semen and vaginal fluids. There is currently no cure for HIV, but there are a range of drug treatments that can allow people who are HIV positive to lead a long and full life. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard treatment for HIV, where at least three different antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are given at the same time. This treatment is very effective at suppressing the virus and stopping the development of the disease.  When a person has been on ART, the amount of HIV present in the blood (viral load) is reduced. After three to six months of treatment, the viral load should have fallen to undetectable levels (undetectable viral load). A commonly used ART is Atripla, which contains the three drugs efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Although this treatment can be very effective, it can cause long-term health problems, specifically problems with the bones and kidneys. A possible reason for this is the Atripla treatment could lead to reduced levels of different vitamins and minerals in the body, such as vitamin D and calcium, which can affect hormone levels. The aim of this study is to find out if treating HIV patients with the ARV’s Darunavir/Ritonavir only (single-drug therapy) is less toxic for bones and kidneys than standard ART.",

The aims of this study is to observe the effects of Procoralan®, a drug that specifically reduces heart rate, on heart failure symptoms, heart rate reduction and quality of life in patients with chronic stable heart failure under daily routine.

During these visits a routine practice investigation will be carried out and a case report form regarding heart failure, co-medications and other diseases will be filled out by the doctor. The patients will be asked to fill out the patient quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D) at each visit.

Very little research has taken place into treatments for erosive lichen planus affecting the female external genital area (vulva) and it is not clear which is the best treatment for people who have severe disease. To find that out, this study compares three most commonly used tablets against an ointment and a short course of steroid tablets. The tablets fine tune or dampen the body's immune system. This is because an overactive immune system is thought to be the cause of erosive lichen planus. ",

                "study_involves": "Participants are randomly allocated to take one of the four treatments, although some of the treatments require additional tablets to be taken alongside them to prevent side effects. Participants are able to use a moisturising cream and strong steroid ointment alongside the tablet treatment. They are given the treatment for 6 months at first, after which time it can be continued if it has been effective. If it has not been effective, treatment can be changed. This is a decision that is made between the participant and their hospital consultant.",

Information was gathered from studies investigating  immunosupression and surgery, studies comparing laparascopic resection of colorectal cancers to open surgery and work done at St Georges Hospital by Mr A.G. Heriot and Mr A.G. Prabhudesai investigating imunosupression and colorectal cancer.  Advice was obtained from Professor D. Kumar (consultant colorectal surgeon at St Georges Hospital) and Professor A.G. Daigleish (consultant oncologist at St Georges Hospital) with input from other specialists in both fields.  Statistical advice from Mr Jan Poloneicki (statistician) was taken to ascertain the number of patients that would be needed to make sure any information collected would statistically be significant.From all the data collected, previous studies performed and upon the advice given it was felt the best way to answer the above hypotheses was to perform a prospective, randomised study on sixty patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer.Patients would be randomly split into two groups using a block number randomisation.  One group would have surgery in the conventional way with a full laparotomy; i.e. any incision length greater than 15cm dependant on patient size and access required.  The other group would have surgery in the identical manner, with the same pre-operative preparation and post operative care except surgery would be performed via a mini-laparotomy; i.e. an incision length of 15cm or less.To answer the first hypothesis regarding post operative immune suppression it was felt that by measuring the acute inflammatory markers, cytokines IL-1b, interlukin-2 (IL-2), TNF-a and IL-6, in venous blood samples both pre and post operatively it is possible to determine the inflammatory response to surgery and subsequent immunosupression.  Blood samples taken at 1 day pre operatively and 3 hours, days 1 and 5 post operative would  allow accurate assessment of the inflammatory response to surgery which at its maximum has been shown to last 6-9 days.  The above cytokines were chosen because they have been shown in numerous studies to be released in response to tissue injury, with systemic levels that correlate with the magnitude of the trauma and inversely relate to the degree of immune suppression.To answer the second hypothesis correlating immune suppression with rates of local recurrence, development of metastases and long term survival additional cytokines will need to be measured pre operatively and post operatively including 2 months after surgery when the acute inflammatory response is known to have ended.  From previous work performed at St Georges it has been shown that increased post-operative levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine -10 (IL-10) appears to be related to the development of distant metastases and patients with high post operative levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-g) developed local recurrence later than those with low levels.  By measuring these cytokines both before and 2 months after surgery it will be possible to see if the mini-laparotomy has any influence on underlying pro and anti inflammatory cytokine levels with subsequent influence on disease progression.In order to measure the cytokine levels heparinised venous blood samples will be obtained and they will be detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques (see below for details).  Quantitative values of the cytokines will also be measured using real-time PCR.The cancer specimens, post-surgical resection, are reviewed by the histopathology department so an accurate staging of the tumour can be made, checking for its degree of invasion locally and distally.  Margins of clearance from the tumour to the excision edge are also measured.  These measurements will enable it to be assessed if there is any significant difference between those resected through a mini-laparotomy and the conventional technique, answering the third hypothesis,In order to assess the extent of tumour cell spillage during mobilisation of the cancer during surgery venous blood samples can be taken from patients during the operation before and after mobilisation or attempted mobilisation of the tumour.  Also blood spilled into the abdominal cavity during the operation can be taken with a heparinised syringe.  These samples can then have the tumour cells extracted by spinning the samples using centrifugation and then magnetically labelling the cancer cells which can then be identified via microscopy.  It then should be possible to assess if by performing a mini-laparotomy there is any difference in the number of tumour cells spilled from the cancer compared to when using the conventional approach.PATIENT SELECTIONPatients with colorectal cancer diagnosed at St Georges Hospital from the 1st of November 2004 will be assessed for suitability for entry into the study.  It must have been agreed by the patient and clinician that surgical resection of the cancer is appropriate and that the patient is willing to undergo surgery.Once the decision is made for surgery to go ahead the patient will be introduced to the chief investigator of the study, preferably in the same clinic or when the patient first is available / willing to have a discussion.  In the initial interview the study will be explained including the full implications to the patient, the risks, the additional inconveniences and investigations along with the potential benefits.  If at that time the patient wishes to consider involvement a full information sheet will be given including a contact number of the chief investigator so that any further questions can be answered.  Once the patient has had time to consider inclusion in to the study or not and is agreement an informed consent form will be signed.STEPS IN STUDY WITH REGARDS TO PATIENTPre Operation:Patient will receive the same pre operative investigations and bowel preparation as per current protocols at St Georges Hospital, which ever group they have been allocated to.  An additional venous blood sample will be taken 1 day pre operation of 20 mls.Operation Day:All patients will undergo surgery with general anaesthetic whilst placed in the supine or lithotomy position.  All patients in the mini-laparotomy group will undergo surgery that uses conventional surgical techniques and instruments via a small abdominal incision.  The incision will be of 15cm or less and its position on the abdomen will be determined by the need to facilitate the most straightforward resection.  The other group will undergo the resection of colorectal tumours using conventional open procedures with conventional techniques and instruments.  The abdominal incision they will receive will be greater than 15cm, as is conventional practice.Venous blood samples of 8mls will be taken from the patient during the operation before and after mobilisation of the tumour. 10mls of blood spilt into the abdominal cavity will be collected in a heparinised syringe.  Total blood loss would also be recorded.Post Operation:Patients will have post operative care using the conventional practice as directed by each specific consultants request within St Georges Hospital colorectal unit with diet being resumed as soon as bowel function returns clinically.  Postoperative times to standing, walking, passage of flatus and urinary catheter removal will be recorded as well as post operative analgesic requirements.  When patients were fully ambulatory they would be discharged.Additional venous blood samples of 20mls would be taken at 3 hours, day 1 and day 5 post operations.In routine general surgical outpatient clinic 2 months after surgery a final venous blood sample of 20 mls would be taken, completing the patients involvement in the study.BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENSThe venous blood samples taken from patients in order to measure cytokine levels will, once collected be diluted and be left for 24 hours incubated in 24-well plates at 37 degrees Celsius in 5% carbon dioxide and either stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or left unstimulated.  The cells within the blood will then be separated off using micro centrifugation and the remaining cell-free supernatant stored at -70 degrees Celsius until analysis.  Batches of collected samples will then be tested for cytokines by using ELISA.  (For methodology please see reference Heriot et al 2002 British Journal of Cancer 82 (5), 1009-1012.) Quantitative, absolute values of cytokine levels will be also measured by using real time PCR techniques (see Wheelan et al (2003) Journal of Immunological Methods 278 261-269).The intra operative venous blood samples including the spilled blood within the abdominal cavity will be diluted and subjected to differential density centrifugation.  The cancer cells will then be labelled with an immunomagnetic antibody so that they can be separated off and identified by microscopic examination.The colorectal cancer specimens will be sent to the histopathology department where they will be fixed, sliced, mounted onto slides and stained so that the pathologists can review them to give accurate staging of the tumour and measure clearance margins.ELIMINATING BIASThis study is clearly unable to be a blind trial as both clinicians and patients will know which procedure is being performed from the onset.  However this is a randomised, prospective study.  The data being collected is objective data, directly from the measurement of cytokine levels, counting tumour cells and measuring clearance margins with no element for researcher bias.TIMETABLE FOR RESEARCHHaving studied the data from St Georges Hospital approximately 500 patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the last five years.  Not all of these patients will have been treated with surgery and of the remaining group not all would have had the appropriate criteria for admission into this study.  However it is estimated that it will take approximately twelve months to recruit sixty patients, needing a further three months to complete all sample collection.During this time it will have been feasible to perform the majority of experiments with a last batch awaiting the final samples.  This would leave four months to analyse the data and interpret it.  At least two publications in scientific journals are planned from the data obtained and a completed report is intended to contribute to my MD thesis.",

The bottles containing the syrup are labeled with medication code numbers unidentifiable for patients as well as investigators The intervention dosage: 20 ml, per os, daily, 30 minutes before dinner, for the 6-month normalization period and for the 24-month on-treatment period (total 30 months).A 12-month extension, free of drug (washout) period is included in the clinical trial design.Note: The design of the study includes a 6-month normalization (essential fatty acids and antioxidant vitamins) period:Specifically the normalization period begins at enrolment and continues for 6 months with regular consumption of the assigned intervention (for both study arms). The end of this period is denoted as the entry baseline. The period between entry baseline and the 24 months of treatment until the study completion (end) is the 'on treatment' period.The 'normalization period' will be a 6-month period between enrolment and entry baseline (the first 6 months of the trial that patients will be on the intervention treatment for only normalization purposes). For the results analysis this 6-month period will be considered as a period before entry baseline for both treatment arms.Due to the nature of the intervention ingredients/agents the protocol of the clinical study is considering a normalization period for the interventions agents to exert their beneficial effect.",

It can present as either a severe infection with a short duration (acute) or a persistant long term infection (chronic). If a person has a chronic HBV infection, over time the virus causes the liver to become irreversibly scarred (cirrhosis), eventually leading to liver failure. There are two main drug treatments available for treating a chronic HBV infection: interferons or nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Interferons can have a lot of unpleasant side effects and rarely results in a cure so most patients choose to be treated with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Although these daily tablets have no side effects, most people using this treatment will need to continue taking them for the rest of their life. There is evidence from a recent study that if treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is stopped after a few years of treatment, some patients may be able to eliminate the virus. The aim of this study is to confirm the findings from this earlier study by seeing if stopping nucleoside/nucleotide analogue treatment can be safely stopped and lead to a cure.",

After this, all treatment is stopped. Participants in both groups attend the clinic at regular intervals over the next three years and provide blood samples to test for signs of HBV.",
                "benefits_risks": "There is a chance that stopping nucleoside/nucleotide analogue treatment (with or without interferon treatment) may allow the patient to be cured.

The blood samples will be used to measure levels of certain blood chemicals and thus evaluate the patient’s liver function, the levels of HBV in the their body and their body’s ongoing response to the HBV infection.

                "background_study_aims": " Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common treatable cause of disability in the Western world. RA affects over 600,000 people in the UK: symptoms impact heavily on patients' ability to perform daily activities at home and ability to undertake work commitments. It is therefore vital to treat this condition effectively and with the minimum of time delay. There have been dramatic advances recently in the development of effective drugs to treat RA with the use of Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocking drugs which have transformed the lives of people suffering from RA. While these drugs are highly effective overall, some patients do not respond well for reasons we do not fully understand yet. Initial studies have shown that when a TNF-blocking drug does not work, switching to one of the other TNF-blocking drugs can be effective. In addition to these drugs, two new drugs, rituximab and abatacept, have also been licensed for patients who do not respond to a TNF-blocking drug. However, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) have only approved the use of rituximab, which means that patients have only one option (rituximab); this option is unsuccessful in reducing disease symptoms in a third of patients. This study aims to provide those RA patients who have failed to respond with an initial TNF-blocker with more treatment choices based on a thorough evaluation of the currently licensed drugs available.",

Alternative mechanism TNF-antagonist drug 2. Abatacept 3. Rituximab Allocation will be by minimisation, stratified by centre, disease duration, primary versus secondary non-response to initial TNFi agent, rheumatoid factor status (RF seropositive or RF seronegative) +/- Anti-Citrullinated Peptide Antibody (ACPA) status and type of initial TNFi agent. All trial patients will have been maintained on a stable dose of MTX to ensure all can be potentially randomised to drugs requiring MTX co-prescription (infliximab), to optimise response to TNF-antagonist drug (synergy demonstrated) and maintain consistency in concomitant medication in the randomised arms. The treatment arms do not include randomisation to conventional DMARDs as patients would have already exhausted/failed DMARDs. Patients will receive their randomised treatment for 48 weeks as part of the interventional phase. Following this, patients will enter the observational phase and be followed-up for up to 96 weeks. During the observational phase, patients will be treated as per the local clinicians discretion. Following randomisation, patients will receive treatments as per standard regimen. For patients randomised to the subcutaneous treatments a week 4 safety visit may also be scheduled. Information on adverse events will be recorded at each visit. Formal clinical assessment (including DAS28 assessment, quality of life and health economic assessment as outlined in the secondary outcomes) will be undertaken at 3 monthly intervals. Data at 6 months will form the basis for evaluation of the primary outcome. All patients will be followed up until completion of the study; the period following the first 12 months will constitute an observational, clinical follow-up period. The clinical follow-up period will capture any such cessation of randomised drug. Screening prior to drug commencement will be in line with standard BSR guidelines. Baseline and 1-year plain x-ray of hands and feet and bone densitometry scan will also be undertaken to look for structural changes (retardation) and bone density change with the three therapies.Previous interventions:Following confirmation of written informed consent, potential patients will be registered into the study in order to perform an eligibility screening.

Symptoms of the disease can follow 1 of 2 patterns. Acute schistosomiasis symptoms develop within a few weeks and include a high temperature, muscle aches, a skin rash and cough. Chronic schistosomiasis symptoms can occur months, or even years, later and include cystitis, passing blood in urine, bloody diarrhoea, vomiting blood, abdominal pain and paralysis of the legs. There is only one treatment of the disease, the drug praziquantel. When given to children, praziquantel is administered empirically, that is at a  dose that has been seen to work before, rather than based on scientific theory, and there have not been, to date, any studies that have looked into how the drug is absorbed, metabolised and excreted (i.e. drug disposition) in children. This study looks at how well different doses of the drug work and how safe it is to use when given to school-age and preschool-age children infected with either Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma haematobium by measuring praziquantel disposition using dried blood spot technology, a method where blood sample is blotted and dried onto filter paper and then taken to a laboratory for analysis.",

The fourth group is a control group and the children are given a placebo (dummy pill). Two stool or urine samples are collected on different days over a  5-day period. Their medical history is also assessed with a standardised questionnaire and they undergo a full clinical examination. Blood samples are taken at different points post-dosing and sent away for analysis. The success of the treatment is determined 19-25 days post-treatment by collecting another two stool or urine samples, on consecutive days, and microscopically examined for schistosome eggs. Children are considered schistosome negative (and therefore cured) if no eggs have been found in the stool or specimens.",

                "background_study_aims": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Healthy nerves are coated in a fatty casing (myelin sheath) which helps messages to travel quickly and smoothly along nerves. When a person is suffering from MS, the immune system, which normally helps to protect against infection, attacks the myelin sheath, stripping it from the nerves (demyelination). This demyelination means that messages cannot travel along the nerves effectively, causing a range of disturbances including loss of vision, problems with balance and coordination and weakness in the arms or legs. At first, the body is able to rebuild the myelin sheath (remyelination) but as the disease progresses to the secondary phase (secondary progressive MS), this process fails and the nerves themselves break down (neurodegeneration), ultimately leading to paralysis and death. One of the most important parts of treatment is delaying the onset of secondary progressive MS as long as possible. Around 85% of MS sufferers are diagnosed with the relapsing remitting type. This is where the sufferer has sudden flare-ups of symptoms (relapses) followed by periods where the symptoms are very mild or disappear completely. The anti-cancer drug bexarotene has shown that it can actually help to encourage remyelination in animal studies. The aim of this study is to find out whether treatment with bexarotene can help to promote remyelination in humans suffering from relapsing remitting MS.",

They will return weekly to see the study nurse for up to 24 weeks and will have urine drug screening, blood tests to check their liver and kidney function, their full blood count and viral load measured weekly for the first four weeks then fortnightly thereafter.  It is to be noted that this is standard NHS clinical practice. Urine drug screening and assessment of any side effects will be noted weekly up to week 24, illicit drug use will be charted and they will be given weekly vouchers of between £5- £10, have their next weeks supply of drug therapy issued and be given a weeks supply of protein drinks. Questionnaires will be collected at their first drug administration and at weeks 6, 12 and 24. At 3 and 6 months post treatment, they will be seen by the nurse and checked for any side effects and be given their final lot of vouchers. They will complete questionnaires at 3, 6, 18, 30 and 42 month post treatment if still contactable. All participants will receive Naloxone (an anti dote to heroin) training 3 times in this study (twice more than routine practice). IV drug users normally inject in company and it is vitally important they have the skills to provide an antidote if one of their peers overdoses, prior to the arrival of paramedics, as there is a serious risk of death from overdosing on heroin.

Accessing specialist services may be an encouragement to reduce their high risk behaviour. The study may not immediately benefit all participants but if the results of the study are positive this may change the practice of managing patients with Hepatitis C who continue to inject drugs and potentially will have a great impact on other such patients in the future.

                "acronym": "ERADICATE Hep C",
                "study_hypothesis": "Rationale:Hepatitis C is a blood borne virus (HCV) that can seriously damage the liver. An estimated 50000 Scots have been infected with Hepatitis C. Only about one third of individuals infected with Hepatitis C are aware of it.The main driver for spread of HCV infection is intravenous drug use. As HCV is highly infectious by the blood borne route through needle sharing, it can infect the drug user early in their habit.The outcome of HCV infection varies considerably between individuals. Some (up to 25%) are able to clear the infection spontaneously, whilst the remaining 75% become chronically infected. Within the subpopulation of chronically infected patients, some will develop serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, within a few years, whilst in others liver disease will not progress even over a period of more than fifty years.Many who are infected are unaware of it, and often show no symptoms over a long period of time. While there is presently no vaccination for Hepatitis C, there are some good treatments. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is dependent, at least in part, on the strain (or genotype) of the virus and stage of the disease. Around 70% of patients will clear infection when treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy, or triple therapy including protease inhibitors depending on genotype of virus. With the advent of more effective therapies of shortening duration, it raises the possibility of using therapy as prevention, turning the epidemic off at source, by targeting active infected drug users who are the main source of new infections.Current treatment pathways focus on populations drawn from those known to drug problem services and former drug users. Some older periodic drug users are tested for HCV and are offered accelerated access into opiate substitution programs and early antiviral therapy. This treatment activity will reduce the health consequences of HCV infection but have little impact on the group with active acquisition of HCV and hence the prevalence of HCV as any patients cured with anti-virals are more than replaced with new infections. The modelling work of Martin et al, illustrates the startling possibility and impact of treating drug users to reduce the prevalence of HCV, the work shows that treating as few as 10 per 1000 drug users per year can have significant impacts on prevalence. The scale of the benefit is exponentially related to prevalence of HCV in the population, the lower the prevalence the bigger the impact. The model has some limitations, it groups all drug users together and assumes a similar risk of infection, if it were possible to access a higher risk of infection group who had a lower starting prevalence of HCV, the benefits in prevalence reduction may be even greater than predicted. Recent unpublished work has reworked the model splitting up the drug using populations and applying Tayside specific demographics and still shows substantial reductions in prevalence. This study will focus on tackling those drug users outside traditional services where the impact on prevalence could be even more impressive, for such a relatively small investment. This group has never been previously targeted for therapy and is believed to be too difficult to achieve the required adherence to therapy. So this study will primarily challenge this assumption.  Chronically HCV infected drug users will be recruited from Needle Exchange services in Tayside and other suitable venues and allocated to treatment dependent on the genotype of HCV. Participants will be followed up weekly for up to 24 weeks with weekly treatment injections given and a weeks supply of medications administered. They will have regular follow up until 2017 when the active patient follow up study ends.To incentivise participants to comply with treatment regimens they will be given a small (£5- £10) value voucher for local supermarkets for attending each appointment. Protein drinks will be given and they will receive regular contact and support via a mobile phone supported by the study team to remind them of drug compliance. In addition low threshold methadone prescribing will be offered. The outcomes will be the success of treatment in this group of patients and the impact it has on the population prevalence of HCV.",

                "intervention": "The major challenge here is to access younger infected drug users and persuade them to engage with treatment for HCV. Most of them do not regard their drug use as a problem and have no motivation to change. However they do perceive Blood borne viruses (BBVs) and HCV as a problem. The 3 stages needed to be overcome for the successful use of treatment as prevention are: 1. Diagnosis2. Initiation on to treatment3. Adherence to therapyWhat is the evidence that this is possible and what mechanisms can we use?1. Diagnosis:The worry of BBV infection alone can be a catalyst for change. We have recently conducted a pilot study using BBV dried blood spot testing in needle exchange schemes where over 500 users were tested with re-contact for giving of results achieved in over 90% of those tested, this intervention did change behaviour in a large number; with those positive seeking enrolment in opiate substitution programs and those negative accessing the exchange for clean works much more frequently. Within this group a number of young infected individuals with high risk patterns of use were identified and successfully tested. The annual NESI study also attains high rates of recruitment of drug users for anonymous testing for BBVs using contingency management in the form of supermarket vouchers. We would in addition use a phone/bring a friend strategy so that most of the other users within given injecting group could be tested and those positive treated to reduce re-infection risk.2. Initiation on to treatment:The act of testing will have established contact and allows us to outline the benefits of treatment and the fact this is on offer without change to drug habits. The incentives for this would be:2.1. The possibility of cure for HCV, 2.2. Low threshold opiate substitution therapy 2.3. Contingency management with supermarket vouchers. 2.4. Low threshold access to opiate substitution is widely believed to be effective at stabilising patients in the short term (which is the need in this situation). Contingency management in drug users has repeatedly been shown to be effective in short term and medium term interventions.3. Adherence: To improve adherence we will use a shortened course of therapy and response guided therapy. To improve the poor adherence expected with conventionally delivered therapy we will use a number of strategies: our intensified patient focussed nurse support pathway, mobile phone technologies for reminders and positive re-enforcement and contingency management.  Treatment would be determined by genotype, these patients will tend to be recently infected with minimal fibrosis, so a higher proportion of early virological responders would be expected.It is to be noted that these are the standard treatment protocols within the NHS treatment services.  Genotype 1 virus would be treated with1. PEGInterferon alpha2. Weight based ribavirin 3. Telaprevir For 12 weeks with a further 12 weeks of combination therapy. Therapy would be stopped if viral load at 4 weeks or at 12 weeks of therapy are >1,000 IU/ml. Those patients who complete 24 weeks of therapy and were not HCV PCR undetectable at 4 and at 12 weeks of therapy would be offered up to 48 weeks of Interferon/ribavirin therapy without contingency management. Patients with cirrhosis who are infected with genotype 1 virus will receive 12 weeks triple therapy with a further 36 weeks of interferon/ribavirin therapy.Genotype 2&3 virus would be treated with 1. PEGInterferon alpha2. Weight based ribavirinThose who achieved an RVR (negative viral load at 4 weeks) would receive 16 weeks therapy, the rest 24 weeks.  All patients will be followed up 12 and 24 weeks post treatment to define Sustained Viral Response (SVR). All patients will be followed up annually to determine re-infection rate for the duration of the study.

                "background_study_aims": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and is an increasingly common problem in our aging society. In the UK an estimated 8.5 million people are affected by OA, causing an enormous burden to health authorities, as well as considerable pain and disability to these individuals. A recent study by Arthritis Care reported that 81% of people with OA experience constant pain and 72% have important related conditions, such as high blood pressure or depression. Hand OA is generally considered to be less important and less disabling than knee or hip OA, but 8% of the UK population are estimated to be effected by painful hand OA, with a large proportion reporting significant difficulties with common day-to-day tasks, leading to reduced capacity to work and impacting on both quality of life and general health. However, despite the prevalence of hand OA, there are still limited treatment options. Current treatments for hand OA are limited since they have been shown to only work for short periods and are not effective for all patients. In addition, many of these treatments have side effects that restrict their use. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used to treat inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, to great effect. It has very few side effects. Recent studies suggest that inflammation is also important in OA, and that by reducing inflammation pain will also be reduced. We believe that hydroxychloroquine may be an effective treatment for reducing inflammation in hand OA and that this reduction in inflammation will lead to a reduction in pain. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether hydroxychloroquine is effective at relieving pain in people with painful hand OA. The secondary aim of the study is to determine whether hydroxychloroquine is able to slow or stop the damage to joints caused by OA. The third aim of the study is to determine whether people with more arthritis-related inflammation in their hand (detected by ultrasound imaging) respond better to treatment with hydroxychloroquine. ",
                "who_can_participate": " People with hand OA from across England. Participants must have moderate to severe painful hand OA that is not responding to their current treatment. In addition, they must have evidence of damage to their joints that is typical of OA – which is detected using an X-ray. There are no age restrictions. ",
                "study_involves": "Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups – the first group will take hydroxychloroquine tablets for 12 months and the second group will take a placebo (dummy) tablet for 12 months. Participants and the researchers running the study will not know which group they are allocated to. Both groups will be allowed to continue taking any other medication for their hand OA that they are using at the start of the study. During the 12 months of the study participants will be asked to attend a special clinic three times for about 1 hour (in addition to a screening visit during which eligibility is assessed) and will be asked to fill in a number of questionnaires and complete a number of hand function tests. At the end of the study we will analyse the change in pain scores between the two groups to determine whether hydroxychloroquine is effective at reducing the painful symptoms of hand osteoarthritis. We will also assess whether hydroxychloroquine improves hand function and slows down the structural damage to the hand joints which is associated with OA. ",
                "benefits_risks": " You may not benefit directly from this study. However, the trial will give us useful information which may be of benefit to others in the future and aid the development of treatment for OA. The main risk involved in taking part is potential side-effects associated with hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine has been used for many years and is relatively safe, with side effects being unlikely. In a small minority of people it can be associated with skin rashes, indigestion, diarrhoea, headaches or blurred vision. Very rarely hydroxychloroquine may damage the retina (part of the eye), but it is important to note that damage to the eye is associated with a cumulative dose of more than 500 g, equivalent to taking the trial medication for 3.4 years. In the duration of this study, the total hydroxychloroquine dose will remain well below this level. To minimise any risk of visual complications participants will be asked about visual impairment (not corrected by glasses) and their eyesight (with glasses where appropriate) will be recorded using a standard reading chart. It is standard practice for all patients taking hydroxychloroquine to have regular blood tests. These are to check that there are no changes to your liver or kidney function during the study. This is not because taking hydroxychloroquine will damage your liver or kidney, but because if you develop liver or kidney problems during the study for another reason, we would need to stop your study medication. We will therefore ask participants to have a blood test before the study, and at 6 and 12 months. There is also a very small risk associated with having hand x-rays for the study. Having an X-ray of each hand will expose you to a small amount of radiation (roughly comparable to the amount of background radiation received in the UK every month). Participants will have an X-ray of each hand at the start and end of the study. The lifetime risk of inducing a fatal cancer in a healthy individual with this dose of radiation is low, about 1 in 500,000. ",

Hydroxychloroquine is used in routine practice at treating synovitis in inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, is widely used anecdotally as a treatment for OA and has been shown to be effective at reducing pain. Hydroxychloroquine has an excellent safety profile, with toxicity generally associated with sustained periods of use that due to the natural history of hand OA are unlikely to be an issue. We propose that treating patients with moderate to severe OA hand symptoms with hydroxychloroquine will be a practical and safe treatment to reduce synovitis and therefore reduce pain. The trial will aim to address the following questions:1. Is hydroxychloroquine an effective analgesic treatment for OA?2. Is hydroxychloroquine cost effective?3. What is the time course for symptomatic relief with hydroxychloroquine?4. Does hydroxychloroquine treatment provide any long term structural benefit?",

                "background_study_aims": " Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) involves taking anti-HIV medications as soon as possible after you may have been exposed to HIV to try to reduce the chance of becoming HIV positive. It is readily available for healthcare workers following occupational HIV exposure (during the performance of their job duties). The current Department of Health guidelines recommend treatment with combination of three drugs for 28 days, which should be started as soon as possible after the exposure, ideally within one hour. Post-exposure prophylaxis following non-occupational exposure to HIV (e.g., sexual contact, sharing of injection drug needles) is increasingly being provided and many countries including the UK have now developed guidelines for its use. However, studies also suggest that PEP is often poorly tolerated, with patients frequently reporting side effects and not completing their treatment. Identifying drug combinations likely to be better tolerated would therefore be extremely useful. The aim of this study is to determine if, when used in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine,  maraviroc is superior to lopinavir/ritonavir with respect to the proportion of patients who complete 28 days of PEP without developing adverse events.",

These drugs are the standard combination currently in use in most centers for PEP in the UK. The experimental group receive 28 days’ treatment with tenofovir/emtricitabine (one tablet once daily) and maraviroc (one tablet twice daily). Participants attend a follow-up visit 3 months after the last dose of medication. ",

No additional blood samples will be required in this study beyond the routine care. Maraviroc and lopinavir/ritonavir PEP may cause side effects. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal (digestive) symptoms, but these are unlikely to require any action since the treatment is only given for short time. The study doctor will advise patients on the appropriate management of any side effects. Maraviroc has not ever been used as a part of HIV PEP so its effectiveness has not been documented, and any potential risks will be monitored and the study stopped if necessary. ",

                "study_hypothesis": "In this study we will assess the delivery and biological activity of sorafenib in cutaneous schwannomas. As cutaneous schwannomas are the hallmark in the patient group of interest- patients with multiple merlin deficient tumours- we have focused our research initially on schwannomas in NF2 patients. Tumours caused by NF2 gene mutation, especially in NF2 patients, present considerable management problems, with current treatment options limited to surgery and radiosurgery. Currently there is no proven drug treatment for merlin deficient tumours. However consensus recommendations to accelerate clinical trials in NF2 have recently been published and include the recommendation of phase 0 trials. We have been investigating potential therapeutic targets in merlin deficient tumours for many years. After detailed target identification, our own studies have shown that PDGFR is massively over expressed and activated in schwannomas. We showed that sorafenib substantially decreases cell proliferation in human primary schwannoma cells by inhibiting PDGFR. Sorafenib is an approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor. There is extensive literature on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of sorafenib and considerable experience with its use, mainly in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Pharmacokinetic studies show that sorafenib is rapidly absorbed and shows steady state levels after 7-10 days. This phase 0 study of 14 patients with cutaneous schwannomas amenable to biopsy is designed to investigate the intra-tumoural penetration and molecular activity of sorafenib in cutaneous schwannoma tissue after 11 days of daily sorafenib dosing compared to pre-treatment levels. It will provide evidence for a drug candidate to be used in Phase II/III multi-centre randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with NF2 patients and patients with merlin deficient tumours, for example inoperable meningiomas, and inoperable schwannomas.",

                "background_study_aims": " A low FODMAP diet is a diet low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides and Polyols. In basic terms, it is a diet low in foods that make extra gases in the intestines. It is a relatively new dietary approach for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms and was pioneered in Melbourne, Australia. It has been researched for a number of years and has been shown to be effective at treating gut symptoms such as bloating, wind, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The diet involves restricting various foods including those grains, fruits and vegetables that are high in FODMAPs, which may reduce diarrhoea related to functional gastrointestinal disorders in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NET). The aim of this study is to find out whether a low FODMAP diet is useful for controlling functional gastrointestinal disorders in NET patients.",
                "who_can_participate": " NET patients with diarrhoea-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders.",
                "study_involves": " Participants are randomly allocated to either consume a low FODMAP diet for 4 weeks, or to be given a Nutrition in NETs booklet.",
                "benefits_risks": " The potential benefits are more likely in the low FODMAP diet group. Since previous studies show a high success rate  (nearly 70%) in controlling diarrhoea-predominant IBS, it is likely that a high proportion of NET patients will  benefit from following the diet. This may, as predicted, lead to improved quality of life and at least weight stablilty. Patients who have been seen already in the NET unit have reported weight gain, reduced diarrhoea and improved quality of life after implementation of the low FODMAP diet.  Some patients may improve on the advice within  the Nutrition in NETs booklet, but only if they did not already learn to  exclude the foods which can lead to the diarrhoea and associated gas production beforehand. After the 4-week study, if  the participant had not improved on that advice, they are welcome to liaise with the dietitian to try the low FODMAP diet.  In the low FODMAP group there is a risk that the patient could lose weight, although this is unlikely because the predicted decrease in diarrhoea from following the diet should aid nutrient absorption and therefore help to maintain weight. The diet only  runs for 4 weeks rather than 8 weeks as it has been found in other studies that improvements are normally seen quicker with patients with diarrhoea-predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders. The low FODMAP diet could also be an inconvenience as it  takes time to learn what foods are allowed and what meals they can cook. Costs of ready made labelled gluten-free items  can cost more than standard products but there are plenty of foods which are naturally low in FODMAPs without  costing more, and the booklets list these and also some recipes to make items at home. There are no perceived risks from being in the booklet group, although it may be slightly irritating for a patient if they wanted to do the low FODMAP diet without starting with the standard care first. The patient may have already recieved this booklet before and not seen a dietitian so they would get to do  this on the study. If the patient would like further help controlling their diarrhoea after the 4-week period they are  welcome to ask for a referral to the dietitian to discuss the low FODMAP diet as any patient would do normally outside  the study. Time taken to be in the study and to fill out forms may also be a inconvenience. Procedures will be done quickly within recommended timeframes without risking bias by pressurising responses of participants.",

One patient group passes through both study phases, whereas the other patient group undergoes the second study phase only.Study phase I ('pharmacokinetic phase') is intended to give information about the pharmacokinetics of Human-cl rhFVIII and is applicable for half of the patients included into this study. Within this phase, patients will visit their study doctor twice for the purpose of a drug administration and subsequent blood collections. The first time, the blood samples will be taken after the injection of the actually used FVIII concentrate, while the other time, the same procedure will be done after Human-cl rhFVIII administration. All patients having completed study phase I are intended to continue with study phase II. The remaining half having not been included into study phase I, will only partake in the second study phase ('open treatment phase') which is intended to prove the efficacy of a prophylactic six-month treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII. As the need arises, also on demand treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII will be possible. Further aims of this study phase would be to investigate the immunogenic and the safety potential of Human-cl rhFVIII.Within study phase II, five consultations with the study physician will take place. Three of them will comprehend a blood collection by which an exclusion of inhibitors will be ensured. The remaining two visits are for incremental recovery purposes, meaning that after having taken a reference blood sample, Human-cl rhFVIII will be administered, followed by two further blood sample withdrawals.In either case the study starts with a Screening Visit, comprehending identical general basic investigations for all patients.",

Healthy nerves are coated in a fatty casing (myelin sheath) which helps messages to travel quickly and smoothly along them. When a person is suffering from MS, the immune system, which normally helps to protect against infection, attacks and gradually destroys the myelin sheath (demyelination). This means that messages cannot travel along the nerves effectively causing a range of disabilities. A number of recent studies have shown that exercise is an effective way of improving functioning and mobility in people suffering from MS. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a 12-week exercise programme in patients with mild to moderate MS.",

Although the results are impressive, patients ultimately relapse and die of their disease. Therefore an improvement in this area is required.  At progression on sunitinib further targeted therapy is not clearly defined although clinical benefit occurs with others forms of targeted therapy supporting the investigation of sequential therapy in this setting. There is no clear consensus on standard second line therapy in this setting. Pre-clinical studies have indicated beneficial combination activity for saracatanib with cediranib. A randomised phase II study is therefore proposed to identify whether the combination of cediranib and saracatanib are more potent than cediranib alone in relapsed clear cell renal cancer after vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy. If this regimen is more potent it will be taken into phase III against standard care in this setting.",

Arm B is cediranib 30 mg + matching placebo to saracatanib. Both are in tablet form. Patients will take the tablets orally once daily for as long as they are receiving clinical benefit.  The median amount of time that we expect patients to be taking the tablets is about 4 - 6 months. Once patients stop taking the drugs due to progression or withdrawal they will be followed up for life. Unfortunately the prognosis for this group of patients is poor (they will have to have relapsed clear cell renal cancer to be eligible for the study) so this period of follow up is not expected to be longer than 2 years. Follow-up will be every 8 weeks. There is scope in the protocol for patients to continue on their study drugs even after they have progressed at the discretion of their treating clinician. However cross-over of treatment is not permitted, so patients will have to continue on whatever combination they were originally randomised to.",

It is associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. There is evidence that antiviral treatment with interferon or with interferon plus ribavirin is effective. On the other hand, standard immunosuppressive treatments may lead to severe complications in HCV-positive patients. Thus, less toxic treatments are needed. Based on early results, rituximab may be a safe and effective alternative to standard immunosuppression. The aim of this study is to compare rituximab treatment with the best available treatment for type II mixed cryoglobulinemia.",

Conventional treatment is chosen by the clinician for the individual patient, and can include treatment with glucocorticoid, azathioprine or cyclophosphamide medications or plasmapheresis, a procedure where the blood is filtered to remove the cryoglobulins. Participants are followed up over 24 months: weekly from day 0 to day 28, monthly up to month 6, then every 2 months  up to month 24. A general physical examination is performed, and vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure and temperature) are taken. ",
                "benefits_risks": " As the study involves patients who require immunosuppressive treatment, possible benefits include the possibility to cure their vasculitis with a less toxic and more effective treatment. Rituximab can cause an infusion related reaction involving fever, chills or rigors. Other commonly reported reactions include nausea, urticaria (hives), fatigue, headache, itching, bronchospasm, dyspnoea (breathlessness), sensation of tongue or throat swelling, rhinitis (inflammation of the inside of the nose), vomiting, hypotension (low blood pressure) and flushing.  While in most patients these reactions are mild to moderate in severity, there have been reports of severe reactions in lymphoma patients. Patients who experience a severe reaction should have their infusion interrupted immediately and should receive aggressive treatment. The infusion should not be restarted before all the symptoms have disappeared. Further treatment of patients after complete resolution of signs and symptoms has rarely resulted in a repeated reaction. ",

                "study_hypothesis": "Type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) or MC syndrome is a systemic vasculitis prevalently mediated by immune-complexes, and associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and B-cell lymphoproliferation. Despite the bone marrow pathologic findings often suggesting an indolent B-cell malignancy, type II MC is definitely a non-neoplastic disorder, as finally demonstrated by molecular analyses of B-cell clonal expansion in extensively characterized patients with long-term follow-up. B-cell expansion and lymphoproliferation occur in target organs of HCV infection. There is evidence of an antigen-driven proliferation of rheumatoid factor (RF) - positive clones, with a restricted immunoglobulin gene usage, leading to cryoglobulin production. Future studies should clarify the preferential and persistent expansion of such RF-positive clones in the course of HCV infection if compared to other chronic inflammatory/infectious conditions. Since only a fraction of patients with HCV infection have positive serum cryoglobulins or develop MC syndrome, additional mechanisms, virus-or host-related, are implicated. Recent studies were focused on insertions or deletions in HCV gene (HVR1-E2 region), HLA genetic predisposition, C4 deficiency, anti-endothelium and anti-alpha enolase antibodies, T-helper 2 profile and cytokines. Finally,  serum cryoglobulins and RF usually persists even after the negativization of HCV RNA with the antiviral therapy. Since RF-positive B-cells may be stimulated by immune complexes containing quite different antigens, HCV infection might be crucial for the induction of MC, while not for the survival of RF-positive clones, which might prove pathogenetically relevant also in the lack of HCV persistence. In the lack of such information, the treatment of HCV-associated MC remains difficult, and strategies should be necessarily focused both on the viral trigger (when present) and on downstream pathogenetic events.There is general clinical evidence that effective antiviral treatment with interferon (old studies) or with interferon plus ribavirin (recent studies) is often accompanied by clinical efficacy, but results may differ in the different systemic features. Thus, even if antiviral therapy has a strong rationale and represents a cornerstone for the treatment of MC, additional pathobiologic events should be dissected and targeted for the different organ manifestations. Furthermore, antiviral therapy may be ineffective, counterindicated or not tolerated, and finally does not allow a rapid improvement in progressive or life threatening MC manifestations.On the other hand, standard immunosuppressive approaches may lead to severe complications in HCV-positive MC patients, including major infections, cytopenias, enhancement of viral replication, and may have direct oncogenetic properties. Thus, less toxic approaches are needed.",

                "background_study_aims": " Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is able to spread to other organs in the body.  The most common sign of the disease is a new mole appearing or a change in appearance of an existing mole. At the moment, there isn’t a widely used treatment option for early stage melanoma patients after they have had their initial therapy that will help prevent the cancer reoccurring. Indeed, the disease coming back remains the biggest challenge in the management of early stage melanoma. This study is investigating the use of stimulators of the immune system, namely unmethylated CpG type-B oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG type B) and Granulocyte/Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF).  The researchers want to know whether these substances can improve the immune response in order to fight the melanoma. ",

                "study_involves": " Participants are randomly allocated to one of five groups. Those in group 1 are given an injection of CpG type B seven days at the tumour excision site (that is the site where the tumour is about to be removed) before undergoing a sentinel node biopsy (an operation that determines whether a cancer has spread beyond the original tumour into the lymphatic system). Those in group 2 are given an injection of CpG type B at the tumour excision site seven days and two days before the sentinel node biopsy. Those in group 3 are given an injection of CpG type B  and GM-CSF at the tumour excision site seven days and two days before the sentinel node biopsy.  Those in group 4 are given an injection of saline at the tumour excision site seven days  before the sentinel node biopsy. Those in group 5 are given an injection of saline  at the tumour excision site seven days and two days before the sentinel node biopsy. All participants are followed up two days after the biopsy and again after seven days to assess their immune response. ",
                "benefits_risks": " A possible benefit of participating in this trial might be that the immune system can effectively fight the melanoma cells that remain in the body after surgery.

                "background_study_aims": " Coronary angioplasty is a procedure which widens coronary arteries that have become narrowed or blocked, due to fatty deposits on the inner arterial wall. A small balloon is fed though to the affected section of an artery and inflated to widen the artery and squash the fatty deposits against the wall. The balloon is then deflated and removed and the result is an increased blood flow though the artery. Sometimes, a stent is used. This expands when the balloon is inflated and remains in place once the balloon is used. Most people will need to take blood thinning medications after an angioplasty. For many patients who have a stent inserted the combination of blood thinning medication that is given is clopidogrel and aspirin. Typically this is given in combination for 12 months and, thereafter, aspirin is given alone. Recently, a new blood thinning drug, ticagrelor, has been developed. A large clinical study has shown that a combination of ticagrelor and aspirin has been shown to work better than  clopidogrel and aspirin. Currently, NHS patients only receive ticagrelor in combination with aspirin. However, in a laboratory setting, ticagrelor has been shown to be a very potent ‘blood thinner’. This may mean that in some patients aspirin is not needed which may be beneficial as aspirin can cause problems such as bleeding. In the GLOBAL LEADERS study patients have been randomly allocated to stop aspirin at one month and continue with ticagrelor or stop ticagrelor at 12 months and continue with aspirin. This is a substudy of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial which aims to see if the ability of the blood to clot is different when aspirin is stopped, compared with when ticagrelor is stopped. We will also measure a chemical called thromboxane; a molecule that increases blood clotting. The production of thromboxane is reduced by both ticagrelor and aspirin. In order to make this measurement blood may be stored for a few weeks or months before this test is carried out following which it will be disposed of as per normal practice. No genetic testing will be undertaken. The aim of this trial is to evaluate whether there is a difference in the likelihood of the blood to clot when aspirin is withdrawn at 1 month versus when ticagrelor is withdrawn at 12 months. A better understanding of clotting after withdrawal of these drugs may allow us to further develop better treatment strategies for patients suffering from heart disease.",
                "who_can_participate": " Adults (aged at least 18) enrolled in the the GLOBAL LEADERS study under the care of the Golden Jubilee National Hospital (UK) during the allocated study period with a narrowing of one or more coronary arteries suitable for coronary angioplasty using a stent.",
                "study_involves": " Two groups of participants take part in the study. One group (group 1) have been previously randomised to change from ticagrelor and aspirin to just ticagrelor 1 month following a coronary angioplasty involving a stent. Group 2 includes participants previously randomised to switch from ticagrelor and aspirin to just aspirin at 12 months (standard treatment group). Measurements of platelet aggregation, high sensitivity CRP and serum and plasma thromboxane are made at the time of recruitment, immediately before the participant stops taking either ticagrelor (Group 2) or aspirin (Group 1). Measurements will also be made at 2, 7 and 14 days after the participants have stopped their medication. This study does not affect patient treatment or their participation in GLOBAL LEADERS in any way.",

Participation in the trial will not affect the patients' care in any way and patients are not paid for their participation in this trial. ",

Although generally well tolerated, it can cause hypersensitivity reactions such as a skin rash in up to 10% of patients. These reactions can result in hospital admission, long-term complications such as blindness, and can cause death in up to 30% of patients. These reactions are caused by the immune system. Recent research has identified that patients with specific genes are at a higher risk of developing this hypersensitivity. Carbamazepine is converted by the liver to other chemical products called metabolites. It is believed that one or more of these metabolites activate the immune system. However, it is not known how this happens. This aim of this study is to assess the stable and toxic products formed in the blood and urine of patients receiving carbamazepine. ",

Lessons learned from this research will provide valuable information for other drugs that cause similar hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. penicillins).

Pancreatic cancer has a very poor prognosis (forcast) with an overall survival rate of less than 5%.  Current treatments are ineffective and even if the patient responds to initial treatments, relapse (the cancer coming back) is common due to the survival of small populations of resistant cancer cells. The immune system is capable of recognising and eliminating invading organisms by virtue of differences in their appearance when compared to normal components of the body.  Cancer cells also have a different appearance compared to normal cells. However, these differences are often too small and weak to stimulate the immune system sufficiently to respond effectively to eliminate the tumour. The aim of this study is to analyse the small differences between healthy and cancer cells in pancreatic cancer patients by analysing genetic information from pancreatic cancer cells and see their ability to stimulate an immune response.",

Immunogenic neo-epitopes can then be combined in a peptide vaccination program using adjuvants such as oncolytic viruses for targeted delivery and expression within tumours of PDAC patients to stimulate robust and long-term anti-tumour responses.",

The population in question are healthy adult male or female volunteers aged between ≥18 and ≤65 years. Participants will be approached by the recruitment team of the clinical research, either from our existing volunteer database (which is bolstered by advertising on a daily basis) or participants responding to advertisements. Once a volunteer is fully registered on PAREXELs database, participants are contacted to discuss the particular study via phone, text or e-mail. Potentially suitable volunteers will then be invited to information sessions held by the responsible investigator to explain study details and participation criteria.

In order to help kidney transplant patients, the monitoring of immunosuppressive medication needs to be improved. New tools have been developed in order to monitor how well the medication works as the standard monitoring tools are not able to directly measure the effects of the medication in individual patients. The aim of this study is to compare the normal method of monitoring immunosuppressive medication (cyclosporin A (CsA)) to the new monitoring tool to see if it improves patient’s health and lowers their cardiovascular risk.

Standard Monitoring Group:Participants receive CsA orally, at a dose adjusted to reach the specified exposure target CsA CO levels of 80 to 150 μg/L. This therapy is monitored by the CsA CO monitoring (80-150 ng/ml), which means blood samples are taken from participants in the morning before medication is ingested and the level of CsA concentration is measured. Adjustment to the CsA dosages are made if necessary at each study visit (baseline, month 1, month 3, month 6 and end of study) due to adverse events. Investigation Group:Participants receive CsA orally at a dose adjusted to to the results of the new monitoring tool. The CsA therapy is monitored by activated T-cell (NFAT)-regulated gene expression (RGE) of 15 to 30%.  The expression of the NFAT-regulated genes (interleukin 2, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating-factor, interferon- y) is determined by qRT-PCR at CsA CO and C2. This means that blood is taken in the morning prior to the medication being ingested and then two hours after. Cytokine gene expression is measured in these samples. Adjustment to the CsA dosages are made if necessary at each study visit (baseline, month 1, month 3, month 6 and end of study) due to adverse events.Following the study, participants receive CsA according to their local center practice.

The Ellex 2RT laser is capable of delivering very short pulses of laser that selectively target pigment granules in the layer of cells that supports the light-sensitive retina. Stimulating this layer with short pulses of laser has been shown to result in the disappearance of waste material from beneath it that is the characteristic of AMD.",
                "who_can_participate": " The study aims to recruit 40 people with early AMD. They will have a risk of developing visual loss as a result of AMD of 12-50% within 5 years in the study eye.",
                "study_involves": " To test the effectiveness of 2RT in the treatment of with intermediate to high-risk Early AMD we will divide participants into two groups at random  half will receive treatment with 2RT laser and half will be exposed to a completely harmless flash of light. We will perform detailed tests of subjects vision before doing this  some of these tests are routinely performed in eye clinics (for example reading an eye chart) others may require subjects to press a button when they see a light (a field test) or to have a scan of the back of the eye. None of these tests involve touching the eye.On the day of the intervention those receiving the laser will have it applied to 12 areas just outside the macula (the part of the eye responsible for central vision)of the eye in which they have the worst vision. This involves putting a drop which dilates the pupil and a drop of some anaesthetic into the eye. A special hand-held contact lens will be applied to the eye to help focus the laser. This process takes about 20 minutes and whilst they may see some flashes of light they should not feel anything except some pressure from the contact lens on the eye.A week after the laser has been applied subjects will be asked to come back for some repeats of the tests they had at the start of the trial. We will then ask them to come back at 6 weeks after the laser was applied, at 3 months and at 1 year.",
                "benefits_risks": "It has been known for many years that applying conventional laser to the back of the eye in patients with Early AMD can cause the disappearance of waste products (known as drusen) from under the light-sensitive retina. It is not known whether triggering the disappearance of drusen is associated with any visual benefit but there are theoretical reasons why this may be so. The laser probably drives the disappearance of drusen by causing a small amount of inflammation when it damages the cell layer under the retina. Unfortunately it can be difficult to control the amount of damage conventional lasers can cause. This trial is designed to test the safety and effectiveness of a new type of laser that is much gentler and causes less damage than those lasers available more widely. Results of a recent trial in Australia suggest that the laser we will be testing in this trial is capable of improving vision in patients with high-risk Early AMD.All laser surgical procedures carry a risk of side effects. We believe the risks of immediate side effects to be much lower with this new type of laser but cannot rule them out completely.If too much laser is applied it can damage the overlying retina and cause a permanent black spot in visual field. We will be applying the laser outside of the part of the retina responsible for central vision but there is a theoretical risk that the laser could strike the centre of the macula and permanently affect a participants ability to read or see faces clearly. If this occurred they would still retain their peripheral vision (outer vision), which means it will not cause complete blindness.Aggressive laser treatment can also cause blood vessels to grow underneath the retina in the treated area again causing distortion or a permanent black spot in the vision. The risks of this are very low and if it occurs the blood vessels usually disappear on their own.The results of other trials investigating the use of this new laser in the treatment of diabetic macular disease suggest that it is at least as effective and safe as standard laser.In the long term there is not enough evidence to say for certain whether the new laser we will be applying does not make AMD worse. There is limited evidence to suggest that much more damaging conventional laser does not cause worsening of vision even 8 years after its application in this context.",

Contact lens: Area Centralis 1:1 laser contact lens (or equiv) to be used for viewing and laser application. Apply this to the eye for intervention.2. Energy setting: Apply test shots of repeated single laser pulses spaced approximately one laser spot diameter (400micron) apart outside the arcades while increasing the energy until a faintly visible blanching of the lasered spot is observed. The starting energy should be set to 0.14mJ and increased by 2 steps until the blanching point is reached using no more than 12 laser shots. Energy is not to be increased beyond 0.4mJ. 3. Illumination should be set to a low level to provide good contrast viewing of blanching. 4. Reduce the energy by one steps of this setting and then apply in the outer macula as described below in point 5  5. Spot placement: 12 laser shots in two arcs of 6 shots superior and 6 shots inferior, inside the retinal vascular arcades at an approximate distance from the fovea of 3000 um, with approximately one laser spot diameter between them.6. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of bleeding within the laser spot area. If this occurs apply slight pressure with the contact lens until it stops and do not apply further test shots. Reduce the laser energy by 2 steps in this case and apply in the outer macula.",

One of its functions is to combat viruses.  Interferon-β has been given as an injection to thousands of patients for other diseases (such as multiple sclerosis). Recent research has suggested that interferon-β might prevent the spread of the common cold from the nose to the lungs of people who have asthma. The common cold virus is known to cause a worsening of asthma symptoms (known as an exacerbation) in some people.  It is hoped that interferon-β will be given as a treatment to people with asthma to prevent an exacerbation of asthma symptoms during a cold. The aim of this study is to find out how safe doses of inhaled interferon-β1a are in patients with asthma. ",

                "study_involves": " Participants are randomly allocated into four groups of ten. In each group, eight participants receive the active treatment (interferon-β1a) and two receive a placebo (a dummy drug). Group 1 receive a low dose as a single dose only.  Group 2 receive a mid dose as a single dose and if this is found to be safe they move on to multiple dosing once every 3 days for a 14-day period. Group 3 receive the highest proposed dose as a single dose and then if this is found to be safe they move on to multiple dosing once every 3 days for a 14-day period. Group 4 also receive the highest dose as a single dose and then if this is found to be safe they move on to multiple dosing once a day for 14 days. The study involves 13 visits to the research facility and four overnight stays. The medication is given in the research facility each time. A follow-up visit takes place 15 days after the last dose of medication. A number of tests (such as lung function tests and many others) are conducted to assess the effects of interferon-β1a.  Samples of blood, urine and sputum (mucus from the lungs) are tested to further understand how interferon-β1a is absorbed, distributed around the body, broken down and excreted from the body.  The samples are also analysed to determine how interferon-β1a is affecting the natural anti-virus defence systems in the body, and to find out whether tests could be developed to see if some asthmatic people are more likely to respond to interferon-β1a therapy than others.",
                "benefits_risks": "It is unlikely that participants will benefit from taking the study drug but the information from this study may help to improve the treatment of people with asthma. As extensive tests are performed which are not routinely carried out, participants will learn more about their asthma and how best to control it. There are unknown risks involved in taking part in the study. The risks of interferon-β when given via injection are known, but the full risks of inhaling interferon-β1a are not known. A similar inhalation study has been carried out using a different make of interferon-β1a. This was given via inhalation to people without asthma. The findings suggest that the transfer of gas in the small airways of the lungs (TLCO) was temporarily affected. The dose given in this study was 10 times higher than the dose to be given in this study. The device and formulation are also different.  As a precaution, TLCO will be monitored throughout this study and treated will be stopped if necessary. As with other medications, people treated with interferon-β1a may be at risk of developing allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. Symptoms of an allergic reaction generally include overall body itching, hives (a sort of rash), skin flushing or rash. Anaphylaxis is a more serious allergic reaction that may involve dizziness, vomiting, low blood pressure and difficulty breathing. This requires prompt medical care and may be life-threatening. Administration of medications by nebuliser inhalation may cause local irritation such as voice alteration, laryngitis or pharyngitis (sore throat).",

                "background_study_aims": "         Malaria is a serious tropical disease caused by a parasite that is spread by mosquitoes. Antimalarial medication is used to prevent and treat malaria. However, resistance to antimalarial drugs can develop when genetic mutations allow the parasite to survive in the presence of the drug. The development of resistance is of huge public health concern. In Malawi, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SDX-PYM) replaced chloroquine (CQ) in 1993 as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria because of high levels of CQ resistance. However, SDX-PYM resistance is increasing. Combination treatment with two or more drugs working by different mechanisms is proposed as a means to delay the development of resistance. Combination treatments containing artemisinin (ART) are proposed as ideal for this purpose because they kill malaria parasites very rapidly and no resistance had been reported at the time of this study. There is also evidence supporting the possible use of a non-ART combination treatment as a possible alternative. Since CQ was withdrawn in 1993 there has been evidence suggesting a possible return of CQ sensitivity. Amodiaquine (AQ) in combination with SDX-PYM has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in Uganda in an area of high-level CQ resistance. This issue is of huge public health importance as combinations of CQ or AQ plus SDX-PYM would be considerably more affordable compared to ART combination treatment. The aims of this study are:1. To compare the effectiveness of different antimalarial combination treatments 2. To compare the development of resistance when using these different treatments3. To investigate what happens to the drugs after they are taken – their absorption and how fast they are eliminated from the body ",

This lowers the risk of the cancer coming back and prolongs patient survival, but its benefit is limited. Chemoradioimmunotherapy is a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy (which uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells) and immunotherapy (treatment that re-awakens the immune system so it can fight cancer).

                "background_study_aims": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), in patients with or without lupus, causes blood clots (thrombosis); any blood vessel in the body is at risk but most commonly a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs. If a clot dislodges from the DVT, it can travel to the lungs, causing life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is the established treatment following DVT and/or PE to prevent further thrombosis, which can be life-threatening. Treatment with warfarin, although effective, is problematic as it can interact with numerous drugs and dietary constituents. Its action can also be affected by alcohol, smoking, other illnesses and exercise. Patients therefore require frequent INR blood tests (INR = International Normalised Ratio, the test used to monitor warfarin), which is inconvenient for the patient and costly for the NHS. In thrombotic APS patients, warfarin effects can be more erratic, because these patients have antiphospholipid antibodies which recognise proteins that bind to the surface of blood cells/vessels as \"the enemy\". They cause thrombosis and can also interfere with the effects of warfarin. Rivaroxaban is a recently introduced oral anticoagulant (blood thinner), which is given as fixed-dose tablets once daily. Unlike warfarin, rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring because it has a predictable anticoagulant effect. Also, unlike warfarin, rivaroxaban does not interact with food or alcohol and has few drug interactions. It is unlikely that antiphospholipid antibodies will interfere with rivaroxaban's effects on blood clotting as, unlike warfarin, it has a very targeted effect on blood. We plan to compare the anticoagulant (blood thinning) effect of rivaroxaban with that of warfarin in patients with thrombotic APS, with or without lupus. We will do this by assessment of a specialised and excellent measure of anticoagulation called the 'thrombin generation test' (TGT). We will also assess rates of bleeding and further thrombosis, and compare serious adverse events and quality of life in patients on rivaroxaban with those on warfarin. If we can demonstrate that the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is not inferior to that of warfarin, and that there is no increase in the rate of serious adverse effects (very unlikely - see below), we believe that this would provide good evidence to change practice for our patients, and make rivaroxaban the standard of care for patients with thrombotic APS, with or without lupus. ",
                "who_can_participate": " Patients with thrombotic APS, with or without lupus, who have had a DVT and/or PE, and have been on warfarin at a target INR of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0) for at least six months will be invited to take part in the study. ",
                "study_involves": " Patients will be randomly allocated to either remain on warfarin or to switch to rivaroxaban. Where possible, trial visits will be arranged to coincide with routine follow-up, and about three additional visits will be necessary. Trial visits will enable face-to-face contact with healthcare professionals to discuss any concerns and patients will be able to contact the Research Nurse to discuss any problems between visits. Two extra blood samples (each about four teaspoonfuls) will be taken prior to random allocation and six weeks later, in addition to routine blood tests. The trial treatment will last for six months and following this, patients will be offered appropriate anticoagulation. ",
                "benefits_risks": " Rivaroxaban is licensed in the UK and approved by NICE for the prevention of DVT/PE in patients undergoing hip and knee replacements and also for the treatment of DVT and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE following an acute DVT; and the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm associated with an increased risk of stroke). Studies on tens of thousands of patients with DVT/PE or other conditions have shown that rivaroxaban is effective with a similar safety profile to warfarin. Indeed, to date in studies on a total of over 65,000 patients no major safety issues have emerged. It is likely that some patients with APS were included in the studies on DVT/PE, but there is no separate information available on this group. ",

                "study_hypothesis": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease that is caused by antibodies against normal blood proteins that bind to cell-membrane phospholipids that can provoke thrombosis. Patients with thrombotic APS experience venous and/or arterial thrombosis in association with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies. These thrombotic events are potentially fatal and patients require long-term anticoagulation therapy, with warfarin the mainstay. APS can also occur in patients with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).Treatment with warfarin, although effective, is problematic as it can interact with numerous drugs and dietary constituents. Its action can also be affected by alcohol, smoking, intercurrent illness and exercise. Patients therefore require frequent monitoring, which is inconvenient for the patient and costly for the NHS. Rivaroxaban is a new, recently introduced fixed-dose oral anticoagulant with predictable anticoagulant effect, few reported drug interactions and no interactions with food or alcohol, and does not require routine anticoagulant monitoring.156 patients with venous thromboembolism on warfarin for at least 6 months at a target INR (International Normalised Ratio; the test used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of warfarin) of 2.5, will be randomised to either continue with warfarin, or to switch to a daily 20 mg dose of rivaroxaban for 6 months. After the therapeutic phase of the trial, patients will be offered what is considered appropriate anticoagulation.The primary aim of the trial is to assess the non-inferiority of the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban in comparison to warfarin. This will be achieved by comparing thrombin generation 42 days after randomisation in the two groups, assessed by the thrombin generation test (TGT), with the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) a key parameter.",

More serious side effects are hypothyroidism, worsening liver function and aggravation of autoimmune diseases, irritability, anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.

Symptoms include fever, headache, sweats and chills, headaches, vomiting, muscle pain and diarrhoea. It is caused by an infection with a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum. It occurs when an infected mosquito bites a human and passes on the parasite into the bloodstream. There is evidence to suggest that malaria can be prevented via a vaccine using infected mosquitoes that that been irradiated but not killed.  The radiation weakens the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which is then taken from the insect and given to a patient in order to trigger an immune response and therefore immunity from malaria. This study looked at whether a minimum of 1,000 bites of irradiated Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes was safe and well tolerated and would result in 100% immunity from  malaria.  ",

Controls were mock-infected irradiated An. stephensi mosquitoes. All true and mock immunized subjects, and infectivity controls, will receive controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) delivered by bite of five P. flaciparum-infected mosquitoes.Rolling recruitment took place at the NMRC Clinical Trials Center between September 1999 and August 2002. A total of 57 subjects were assessed for eligibility and 16 were excluded. The remaining 41 subjects, who met all screening criteria, were enrolled and assigned to the true-immunized (22 subjects), mock-immunized (13 subjects) and infectivity control (six subjects) groups. The group allocation was completed via convenience allocation and the controls (naïve subjects receiving controlled human malaria infection) were recruited and enrolled when needed prior to CHMI. Thirty of these 41 enrolled subjects initiated the immunization regimens (17 true-immunized, 13 mock-immunized), and three true-immunized underwent CHMI in 1999-2000 and seven true-immunized underwent CHMI in 2001-2002. Immunization was performed when PfRAS were available resulting in varying immunization schedules.1. True-immunized group: Five subjects enrolled in 1999-2000 completed six immunizations and three subjects received CHMI in the first cohort in 2000.  Ten of 14 subjects enrolled in 2001-2002 completed five immunizations, and seven of these 10 subjects completed six immunizations; six subjects who completed six immunizations and one subject who completed five immunizations  (total seven subjects) received CHMI in the second cohort in 2002. 2. Mock-immunized group: In parallel to the true immunization group, seven subjects received at least 5 mock immunizations over 175-239 days receiving a total of 1,210-1,890 irradiated non-infectious mosquito bites. None of these subjects underwent CHMI.  3. Control Group:  Six participants were recruited for the control group (infectivity controls). The CHMI procedure consisted of five non-irradiated mosquitoes, infected with the same NF54 strain of Pf used for immunization were allowed to feed once for five minutes on the subjects. All fed mosquitoes were dissected to determine the infectivity rate. Replacement mosquitoes for those of the initial five not feeding or feeding but found on dissection to have gland grades of 1 or less (10 sporozoites or less) were then allowed to feed and this process was repeated until five infectious bites had been achieved. Beginning seven days after CHMI, subjects were assembled each night in a regional hotel for clinical monitoring by study staff. Each morning, thick blood smears were made for microscopic examination, and sufficient passes over the slide were made using the high power objective such that approximately 40 µL of blood were examined. The presence of two parasites was required for a positive diagnosis, leading to immediate antimalarial treatment with chloroquine phosphate. The treatment regimen was directly observed and included 1000 mg chloroquine phosphate salt (600 mg chloroquine phosphate base) immediately, 500 mg salt (300 mg base) at 6 hours and again at 24 and 48 hours. Subjects who were positive were monitored daily by symptom checks and blood smears until three consecutive negative smears were documented, and subjects remaining negative were similarly monitored until day 21 post CHMI, then approximately every other day until day 28.

Reason for exclusion of older adults: increased risks associated with blood volumes needed for this study in individuals with a greater probability of occult cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease2. Pregnant females and females that are  breast-feeding. Reason for exclusion: the immunological changes accompanying pregnancy and  lactation could alter the results of the assays performed3. Weight less than 110 lbs. for Groups 1 and 3. Reason: volunteers have to meet NIH donor eligibility criteria of weight > 110 lbs. in order to be apheresed at the NIH facility4.  Known immunodeficiency (e.g. HIV positive), history of autoimmune or connective tissue disease,  splenectomy, use of steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or any  immunosuppressive  therapy. Reason for exclusion: immune deficiency or  immunosuppressive therapy could affect the immunological responses of volunteers and thus the results of the outcome measurements performed in this study5. Evidence of active (acute or chronic) hepatitis B or C infection. Reason for exclusion: a serious, underlying medical condition could affect the immunological responses of volunteers  (as above) or could increase the risk or severity of adverse events associated with participation in this study.6. Clinical or laboratory evidence of significant hepatic, renal, cardiac, immunologic or hematologic disease. Reason for exclusion: same as for 5.7. History of malaria infection, exposure to malaria infection, or receipt of a malaria vaccine.  Reason for exclusion: New group 1 volunteers: a principal objective of Stage A is to study the  transition from non-immune to immune status, and this will not be possible if volunteers are partially immune prior to immunization; Group 2 volunteers (infectivity controls): any pre-existing immunity could prevent these volunteers from acquiring malaria following challenge, falsely indicating that the challenge sporozoites were not viable; Group 3 volunteers (immunology controls): these are the malaria-negative controls for our laboratory assays, and thus cannot have a history of malaria or exposure to malaria.  NB1: This criterion does not apply to the six volunteers from the previous  irradiated sporozoite protocol who may elect to enroll in this protocol.  NB2: If it is impossible to find enough volunteers meeting this criterion, it may be relaxed for Groups 1 and 3 (e.g., volunteers will not be excluded because of history of exposure to malaria)8. History of anaphylactic reaction to mosquito bites for Groups 1 and 2 volunteers, or Group 3 volunteers if they are to undergo mock-immunization. Reason for exclusion:  to avoid increased risk of anaphylaxis9. Any other significant finding which in the opinion of the investigator would increase the risk of an adverse outcome for volunteers in this protocol, or to compromise the scientific objectives of   this protocol",

Moreover, combination therapy is shown to be superior to monotherapy. The combination therapy with rheumatoid arthritis (COBRA) therapy is effective in several trials, and the positive effect on radiologic progression sustained over time. In a recent trial (BeSt [treatment strategies for Rheumatoid Arthritis] = see http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN32675862 for more details of this trial) comparing different treatment strategies the COBRA therapy and initial therapy with infliximab (a tumour necrotising factor [TNF]-blocker) were equally effective in improving functional ability and preventing radiographic damage.

The process of minimisation is superior to conventional randomisation in that optimal balance can be achieved over a larger number of variables than can otherwise occur through conventional stratified randomisation.

It is generally spread by breathing in tiny droplets released into the air by an infected person coughing or sneezing. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other areas of the body such as the bones, brain and kidneys. It is particularly common in third world countries and an infection can be devastating if it is not treated.

Seven days after treatment the children are brought in to the study clinic and lab for a thorough check, and those with any potentially infectious parasites in their blood after checking under the microscope are asked to give an additional blood sample.

Any potential risks from this study would be as a result of the effects of Lopimune exposure on the vaginal and cervical tissue (e.g. vaginitis, cervicitis, dryness, itching etc) and systemic  side effects as documented for oral Lopinivir.

Women identified  with high risk HPV will be will be provided with further information and counselling. Women identified with invasive cervical cancer or cervical dysplasia will be sent for colposcopy. Immediate treatment will be given for those with invasive cancer.Those women with cervical dysplasia will be offered enrolment into the Lopimune stage of the study. This will consist  of 1 Lopimune capsule twice daily for 2 weeks. All women will be examined every 2 days for adverse reactions. At 1 month post treatment they will be given colposcopy and a repeat LBC and HPV test. At 3 months post treatment this will be as per 1 month follow up, but extended to include a punch biopsy for histological examination.

If gingivitis is not treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop, which can lead to the bone in your jaw to decay and your teeth to fall out. Periodontitis is diagnosed once irreversible tissue destruction has already occurred, so we need to find a way to diagnose the disease at an earlier stage. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of signalling proteins called cytokines in fluid sampled from the inflamed gums of patients with gingivitis and periodontitis. The secondary aim was to investigate the effect of periodontal treatment with and without omega-3 supplementation on the cytokine levels and the bone density of the tooth sockets. ",

Hepatitis C is the most common type of viral hepatitis. In an infected person, the hepatitis C virus is particularly concentrated in the blood, and so it can is easily spread through blood-to-blood contact, such as sharing needles amongst drug abusers or receiving contaminated blood products in hospital. In the early stages (acute hepatitis) a person often has no symptoms, and so does not know that they are infected. This means that about 80% of infections are able to move to the long-lasting stage. Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is where a person has been infected for more than six months. Sufferers tend to feel extremely tired, achy and generally unwell. Left untreated, the infection causes the liver to become irreversibly scarred (cirrhosis) which can lead to liver failure. Many studies have shown that people suffering from CHC have a lower quality of life than a healthy person. As well as the physical symptoms, more than a third of people with CHC suffer from mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, which many find difficult to cope with. Problem solving therapy (PST) is a type of talking therapy which has been very effective in treating depression. It aims to teach people how to identify and solve their own problems without becoming stressed or upset. The aim of this study is to find out if PST can help improve the quality of life in patients suffering from CHC.",

During these sessions, participants are given a chance to talk about problems they experience in their day-to-day life and are taught techniques to help them solve these problems when they next face them. Participants in the second group are placed on a waiting list for the PST and do not receive any therapy. At the start of the study, after the final session and 6 months later, participants in both groups are asked to fill out a questionnaire to find out how they are coping and whether their quality of life has improved. After the final testing point (6 months after the last PST session), participants in the second group are given the chance to take part in PST.",

This discussion is facilitated by a trained psychologist.

In South-Africa tuberculosis accounts for more than 80% of all communicable diseases and is regarded as one of the most serious health problems affecting the country. There are an estimated 556 cases per population of 100,000 each year, with the highest incidence in the Western Cape. HIV infection is the greatest individual risk factor for tuberculosis and more than half of smear-positive patients are HIV-infected in South Africa. A recent Indonesian study investigated the combined effect of vitamin A and zinc supplementation to adults with pulmonary tuberculosis. Conversion of positive sputum smears was significantly faster in the micronutrient group than in the placebo group after 2 months of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Earlier sputum conversion is critical in terms of tuberculosis control in South Africa. Our study will therefore aim to determine the efficacy of a low cost micronutrient intervention on short-term outcomes such as bacteriological and immunological responses as well as clinical and nutritional parameters in smear positive adult pulmonary TB patients within the context of co-infection with HIV.",

If your low sexual desire is caused by a bad relationship with your partner, a high amount of stress, another illness that you have, or it is a side effect of medication that you are taking, you do not have Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. There are several medications being tested to see if they help solve these problems in sexual desire. One of these medications has two active ingredients: testosterone and sildenafil. Testosterone and sildenafil have to be taken in two different ways because otherwise, the medication doesn’t work. The testosterone is dissolved under the tongue and the sildenafil tablet is swallowed. In earlier studies, these two ingredients were administered separately (the old way). Now a tablet has been made that combines these two ingredients into one tablet (the new way). This study investigates if these two different ways of taking the medication, the old way and the new way, are the same. This is done by comparing the blood levels of testosterone and sildenafil in women who take the medication in the old way and in the new way.  ",

                "background_study_aims": "This study aims to find out whether chloroquine reduces the number of dengue viruses in a patient with a dengue infection. Dengue fever is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral disease in humans. Severe forms of dengue infection can result in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Currently, no vaccine or treatment exists except for supportive care. Studies have shown that the dengue virus needs a certain level of acidity (or pH) in order to enter into human cells. Chloroquine is a drug known to affect other viruses that require a pH-dependent step to enter human cells. Therefore, this study will test whether chloroquine shows potential to be a treatment for dengue-infected patients by reducing the number of viruses that infect cells. ",

They must be over 14 years of age and weigh more than 45 kg, with no previous history of hypersensitivity to chloroquine, and cannot be pregnant or be receiving therapy for other disorders. ",
                "study_involves": " Prior to recruitment, all patients will have a standard clinical examination, a chest x-ray and a blood test to count the number of dengue viruses. The patients will then be randomly allocated to either group A or group B. Group A patients will receive chloroquine treatment and group B patients will receive a placebo (dummy) tablet. The study will then compare dengue outcomes in patients receiving placebo versus chloroquine by measuring fever clearance time and the time until tests show no presence of dengue virus. All adverse events will be fully recorded including duration, severity, outcome and relationship to study drug. Liver function tests will be repeated at discharge in all patients.    ",

                "background_study_aims": "Latent tuberculosis (TB) infection is an infection with TB that is asleep and is not causing the person to be sick or unwell. However, some people with latent TB infection can develop TB disease. We are doing a clinical trial to find out if a new treatment works to treat latent TB infection and prevent active TB.  Isoniazid (INH) is an antibiotic that is about 90% effective if it is taken every day for 9 months.  Rifampin (RIF) is another drug that we know is very effective to treat TB disease.  However, rifampin has not been used much to treat latent TB infection.  We wish to find out if RIF taken for only 4 months would be as effective as 9 months of INH to treat  latent TB infection and prevent you from ever getting sick from TB.   ",
                "who_can_participate": " Children aged under 18 diagnosed with latent TB infection.",
                "study_involves": " We expect that you will be in this study for 16 months (1 year and 4 months).  If you agree to take part in this study you will be randomly allocated to take either 4 months of RIF OR 9 months of INH. Both INH and RIF are taken once a day and both may be taken as a pill or as a liquid.  You will have regular follow-up visits with your doctor and/or the TB clinic nurses.  This will mean coming back for visits at least every month for the first 2 months and then according to what your doctor feels would be needed until your treatment is finished. You will be asked  about the treatment and whether you are having any difficulties taking it.  Your doctor will examine you.  Blood tests will be performed at the beginning of the treatment. Your doctor may want to see you and/or ask for blood tests more often.  If so, you and your doctor will decide on this. After the treatment is finished we will contact you to check-up on you every 3 months up to 16 months from the day you started the study. ",
                "benefits_risks": " Some adults taking INH have had the following mild reactions: headaches, fatigue, weakness, stomach upset, heart burn, loss of appetite, diarrhea or a rash. Some people may have a more severe reaction, possibly affecting the liver, although this seems to be very rare (less than 1 in 1000 children). The following mild reactions have occurred in some adults taking RIF: headaches, fatigue, weakness, stomach upset, heart burn, loss of appetite, diarrhea or a rash.  RIF can also cause tears, sweat, saliva, faeces and urine to turn orange. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained with this orange color. Some people may have a more severe reaction such as a reaction in the liver although this seems to be very rare (less than 1 in 100 people) in people taking RIF only. All of these types of reactions usually return to normal when the medication is stopped. You will have to do a blood test at the beginning of the study.  This may cause some discomfort, including a brief pain from the needle stick, bruising, light-headedness and rarely infection where the needle enters the vein. For female adolescents: INH and RIF have not been found to cause birth defects in babies.  However, you should not take part in this study if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant before completing the TB treatment.  We strongly recommend you  take all necessary measures to avoid becoming pregnant while on the TB treatment.  RIF can make some forms of birth control,  including the birth control pill, hormonal injections and  implants less effective.  If you are using any of these methods and take RIF, you should speak to your doctor about additional methods of birth control methods to use.  These methods may include  condoms, diaphragms, sponges, cervical caps or intra-uterine devices. If you become pregnant, you will be taken off the treatment for latent TB infection.  Your doctor will decide with you about re-starting treatment for latent TB infection, after your baby is born.When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?

Body mass index (BMI) less than 10th percentile for their age2. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA's) are ex-vivo tests of immune response to TB antigens, that have been adopted in some centres as alternatives to the TST, although WHO has recently recommended IGRAs should not be used to replace the TST in low and middle-income countries3. If an eligible child undergoes a commercially available IGRA (the Quantiferon-Gold or T-Spot.TB), instead of a TST, and the result is positive, then they will be considered eligible4. If both TST and IGRA are done, then the TST result will be used to determine eligibility5. The TST may be negative for up to 8 weeks after primary infection, before adequate cell mediated immunity develops6. Because of this, current practice is to begin LTBI treatment therapy immediately for children < 5 years old, even if TST negative7. After 8-10 weeks the TST is repeated; LTBI therapy is continued if now TST positive, and stopped if still negative8. Providers may continue therapy in very young, HIV infected or malnourished children9. We propose to enroll TST negative children aged < 5, if the treating physician prescribes LTBI therapy, because: 9.1. Primary endpoints are still relevant, and measurable in this group9.2. Acceptability and completion in this sub-group are of particular interest 9.3. Children that have new primary TB are at particularly high risk to develop disease (this is the rationale for their treatment)10. If the treating MD stops therapy because the TST is negative after 8-10 weeks, these children will be excluded from the analysis of treatment completion, but included in the incidence density analysis (person-time) of tolerability and safety",

                "study_hypothesis": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious problem. Currently, pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment can result in cure. However, the average overall cure rate is about 55% of patients. This average depends on the viral genotypes (substrains). For example, the cure rate is lower in HCV genotype 1 and 4 than HCV genotype 2 and 3. In addition, patients with liver cirrhosis (scarring) have a lower chance to respond to treatment.  Furthermore, there is new scientific evidence that disturbance in insulin metabolism, which is called insulin resistance, may lower the treatment response. Insulin resistance can be caused by obesity and/or diabetes mellitus (DM). Now, there is new evidence that HCV per se can cause insulin resistance. This means that any patient with HCV infection could have insulin resistance even if he/she is non-obese and non-diabetic. As insulin resistance can decrease the chance of cure in response to current treatment, so improving insulin resistance may improve the treatment response and overall cure rate. Insulin resistance can be improved by pioglitazone oral tablets treatment which is currently used for patients with DM. The objective of this study is to improve the overall cure rate in response to treatment by pegylated interferon and ribavirin by addition of pioglitazone to improve insulin resistance.",

                "background_study_aims": ":Heart disease is very common among patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Also, RA influences the amount of muscle these patients have and several of them lose part of their muscle mass as the disease progresses. Despite the significant improvement in the medication and overall management of RA patients, both heart disease and muscle loss are still very common in these patients. In the general population we know that exercise is a very good way of reducing the risk for heart disease and also the best way to maintain healthy and well functioning muscles. For this reason we want to study the effects of a 6-month exercise training programme on heart disease risk and muscle mass in patients with RA.",
                "who_can_participate": "The study is open to patients with diagnosed RA that do not exercise regularly (no more than once a week for the last six months). However, patients who have had joint surgery recently (during the last 6 months), have been amputated, are receiving steroids by injection (during the last 3 months), have been diagnosed with any metabolic conditions (such as type II diabetes), or other wasting diseases (such as cancer, COPD, kidney failure etc.), or heart disease are not suitable for the present study. In total we will recruit 40 patients and divide them in two groups, one that will be exercising and one that will serve as a control (no exercise).",
                "study_involves": "All patients in both groups will be assessed for a number of parameters at the beginning of the study, as well as 3 months and 6 months later. Specifically, we will measure their aerobic capacity (how much exercise can they do and how fast they can go), the activity and severity of their RA (how good or bad their disease is at the moment of the assessment), their risk for the development of heart disease (blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar), and the way their blood vessels work.Patients in the exercise group will have to exercise three times a week. They will be following a specific programme that we will make for them, based on their individual needs (as measured during the various tests). Each exercise session will last about 60 minutes and during this time they will perform several aerobic exercises (4-5 minutes long at relatively low speeds or resistance) and from three months onwards, we will add some resistance exercises (weights) to help them improve their muscle mass and function.Patients in the control group will receive verbal information on the benefits of exercise, but we will not give them a specific exercise programme to follow. They will have to decide for themselves whether they want to exercise or not and what sort of exercise they want to be doing. ",
                "benefits_risks": "Possible personal benefits: Patients in the exercise group are likely to benefit directly from the study. Their fitness is very likely to improve; higher fitness levels are associated with better health overall and most significantly with low risk for heart disease. Patients in the control group are highly likely to be motivated towards a more active lifestyle, which could result in improved fitness with beneficial effects for their heart and overall health. Also, patients will be screened for risk factors for heart disease (such as your cholesterol) and if any are present, they will receive appropriate treatment. General benefits: The information we will gather from all the people taking part will help us to understand much better some of the mechanisms that may be responsible for causing the heart and blood vessel problems of people with RA. Even more importantly, it may help us to identify ways of reducing these problems. In the future we hope we will be able to apply this knowledge to many more people with RA.Possible risks: However helpful it may be, exercising may also carry some risks. Cases of falls, injuries, heart complications (such as heart attacks), even death, have been reported while exercising on less than 1 in 10,000 occasions - this is about 6 times less likely than having a serious road traffic accident in everyday life. During testing in the hospital laboratories (which usually test people at much higher risk for heart problems) all necessary precautions for this are routinely taken to minimise them.",

Intervention: Based on the results of an exercise stress test, an individualised exercise programme will be prescribed for each participant. All available equipment (treadmills, cycle ergometers, hand ergometers, row ergometers, etc.) will be considered for utilisation. The decision about the exact equipment that will be used will depends on the patients' preferences, and the exercise physiologist's assessment on their ability of achieving the training targets stated below. Volunteers will be asked to maintain increased intensity (indicated by heart rate corresponding to 70% maximal oxygen uptake [VO2max]) for a duration greater than 30 minutes during each exercise session. Three exercise sessions per week will be prescribed. Two sessions will be conducted in a supervised environment and one in a non-supervised setting. During the former, heart rate and rate of perceived exertion will be monitored, whereas for the latter session, heart rate monitors (Polar S610i, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) will be handed to patients. Heart rate monitoring will be used during each session to ascertain exercising at the prescribed intensity (i.e., for measuring adherence). In the case of absence, patients will be asked to replace the missed session(s). Sessions will last about 55 minutes; 10 minutes warm-up, 30 - 40 minutes main session, and 5 - 10 minutes cooling down. Mode, intensity, duration and frequency of exercise will be reconsidered every month, in line with the principles of exercise periodisation. Supervision for the first three sessions will be on a one-to-one basis. In the case that a volunteer requires more assistance, full supervision will continue until they are properly familiarised with the equipment and feel confident to exercise alone. Thereafter, patients will be exercising in a semi-supervised setting. Researchers will be available to assist if patients desire so, or in case of emergency. For the purposes of this research study, the duration of the exercise training for each patient will be 6 months. After that period participants in both groups will be offered the opportunity to continue on an exercise programme.Control: At the time of their baseline assessment, participants in the control group will receive advice (orally and in the form of widely available leaflets by the British Heart Foundation and the Arthritis Research Campaign) on the benefits of exercise; however, no other help or support, as far as exercise is concerned, will be provided.",

                "primary_outcome_measure": "Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) has been selected as the primary end-point because of its importance as a surrogate predictor of cardiovascular events and because it is the only relevant parameter that has been previously assessed pre- and post-exercise interventions in RA patients. In studies with RA patients, or healthy participants exhibiting similar baseline CRF values to RA patients, CRF increased by approximately 20% (standard deviation [SD] = 6.0) following exercise interventions similar to the one we are proposing. We, therefore, included in our power calculation (nQuery Advisor v 6.0, Statistical Solutions, MA, USA) 20% as the expected change (i.e., from 25 ml/kg/min to 30 ml/kg/min) with SD = 6.0. The desirable number of participants for our study to produce significant results (p = 0.05) with a power of greater than 0.80, is 19 in each group. To allow for participant attrition, estimated at 25% for the six-month exercise intervention, we will recruit 25 RA patients in each of the groups. Data from participants with less than 75% compliance will be excluded from the analyses.Assessment of CRF:Exercise tolerance testing (ETT) will be adopted. Depending on each patient's functional limitations, a treadmill, a cycle ergometer or an arm ergometer will be utilised. CRF will be determined using a calibrated breath-by-breath system (Metalyzer 3B, CORTEX Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) allowing continuous measurement of oxygen uptake (VO2), and lung ventilation. During ETT, blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac function using a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), will also be monitored. Relevant data will be automatically stored every 30 seconds. Heart rate corresponding to 70% VO2max will be used to determine optimum exercise intensity.Treadmills and cycles are the most commonly used devices for clinical exercise testing. The treadmill provides a more common form of exercise (i.e., walking) and patients are more likely to attain a higher oxygen consumption compared to cycling. However, cycling is a non weight-bearing activity, and, as such, might be more comfortable for patients with RA. Arm ergometer is an alternative method for exercise testing for patients that can not perform leg exercise, however, because lesser muscle groups are used, oxygen consumption is 20 - 30% lower compared to treadmill exercise. For non physically-active individuals, protocols with smaller increments between stages, such as ramp protocols, are more suitable. For treadmill testing, our protocol will start at a speed of 2.0 mph for 1 minute. Speed will increase thereafter by 0.5 mph every 1 minute until 4.0 mph. Thereafter, inclination of the treadmill will increase every 30 seconds by 1%. Testing is terminated when the participant reaches voluntary exhaustion. Cycle protocol will start with the patient cycling at 60 - 80 revolutions per minute with initial resistance of 25 Watts (W), as in the modified Astrand-Rhyming protocol. The resistance will be increased by 15 W every minute, until patient reaches voluntary exhaustion. Similarly, in arm ergometry, a constant cranking rate of 50 - 60 revolutions per minute will be kept. Initial resistance of 10 W will be increased by 5 W every minute.Timepoints of assessments: CRF will be assessed at three different timepoints: 1. Baseline; before the participants are allocated to a group (intervention versus control)2. Three months after the intervention (or control condition) has began3. Six months after the intervention (or control condition) has began",
                "secondary_outcome_measure": "Cardiovascular outcomes:1. Individual risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 10-year CVD event probability: individual CVD risk factors (i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, hyperinsulinaemia) will be assessed. On the basis of these, the 10-year CVD event probability will be calculated using the latest version of the Joint British Societies' risk calculator.2. In vivo endothelial function: endothelial function in the macrovasculature will be assessed using flow mediated dilation when the patient is in a fasted state. The brachial artery will be monitored by Doppler Ultrasound (ACUSON Antares ultrasound system with a VF 10-5 Transducer and SieClear, BW SieScape Imaging software, Siemens PLC, Munich, Germany) before, during, and after flow mediated dilation as well as administration of a single dose of nitro-glycerine (Glyceryl Trinitrate oral spray). 3. Endothelial function in the microvasculature will be assessed using Laser Doppler dual wavelength imaging (Moor LDI-2 SIM, Moor Instruments Ltd, Devon, UK). Acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and sodium nitroprusside, and endothelium-independent vasodilator, will be separately administered by iontophoresis. Blood flow will be assessed continuously 1 minute before iontophoresis and 2 minutes after iontophoresis using laser Doppler imaging.Rheumatoid arthritis outcomes:1. Disease activity: using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28). This is a composite assessment consisting of the patient's self-assessment of overall health during the last week on a visual analogue scale, a 28-joint count and the current erythrocyte segmentation rate (ESR). Serological assessments of disease activity are described below.2. Physical function: using the Anglicised version of the 40-item Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Participants will rate their ability (over the past week) to carry out 20 activities within eight aspects of daily living (dressing/grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach grip and errands/tasks) on a four-point scale from 'without any difficulty' to 'unable to do'. For each aspect patients also respond whether they receive assistance from people or use specific devices. The HAQ is internally consistent (a = 0.89) and has excellent pre- to post-physician visit temporal stability (r = 0.99). Physiotherapists' ratings have excellent agreement with RA patients' ratings.  3. Psychological well-being: anxiety and depression will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS consists of 14 items (7 each for anxiety and depression) rated on various four-point scoring systems. Comparisons with psychiatric ratings have shown both subscales to be discriminantly valid. The subscales are also internally consistent (a = 0.85 and 0.78, respectively) and convergently valid among RA patients. Quality of Life will be assessed using the EuroQol (EQ-05). The EQ-05 questions self-assessed problems across five items on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, discomfort and depression/anxiety. Each item has three levels of severity: 'no problems', 'some problems' and 'severe problems'.  4. Serological assessments of risk factors, inflammatory mediators and endothelial function: full blood count, serum biochemistry, ESR, high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], blood glucose, lipids, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and thrombotic variables will be assessed using routine laboratory procedures in our laboratory. Internal quality controls on all analysers are carried out daily, and external quality controls fortnightly, utilising the Welsh External Quality Assurance Screen (WEQAS). Insulin will be measured using a solid phase two-site chemiluminescence immunometric assay using an Immunolite 2000 Analyser (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by calculating the Homeostasis Model Assessment - Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI). Relevant cytokines and adhesion molecules (vascular panel, including: interleukin 1a [IL1a], interleukin 1b [IL1b], IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, tumour necrotising factor alpha [TNFa], interferon-gamma, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, macrophage chemo-attractant protein-1, inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-Selectin, P-Selectin, L-Selectin) will be measured using a fully automated RANDOX biochip array system (Randox Laboratories Ltd, Co. Antrim, UK) in our research laboratory. This performs simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple analyses from a single sample.Timepoints of assessments:1.

However, its effectiveness is limited by the need for lifelong adherence to medication, the risk of medication burnout, medication side effects, cost and the risk of the virus becoming resistant to the treatment. This study evaluates whether the strategy of treating children until their immune cells have recovered, stopping the treatment and only restarting it when the immune cells fall below normal levels, works as well as continuous treatment. ",
                "who_can_participate": " Children aged 6 months up to 12 complete years can participate if they have been proved to have the HIV virus in their body and if their parents or guardians give informed consent. Children aged 6 years or more must also agree to be included in the study. ",
                "study_involves": " Children will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups. One group of children will be treated continuously with HAART while children in the second group will be treated only when the number of immune cells in their body drops below the normal level. During the study blood will be drawn during monthly visits to the clinic to check the amount of virus in the body, the level of immune cells, and whether the main organs of the body are working well. ",
                "benefits_risks": " The risks and discomforts of participating include frequent clinic visits, pain during blood draws, side effects from the medicines used and the possibility that on and off treatment may not work well. To minimize these risks and discomforts blood will be drawn only when necessary and the children will be closely monitored by qualified nurses and doctors.

                "background_study_aims": "Patients who require an operation to remove a part of their liver currently receive excellent care in the Royal Surrey County Hospital unit. However, it may be possible to make it even better by using an Enhanced Recovery Programme (ERP). An ERP comprises a number of changes to the way in which patients are managed around the time of their operation:1. Better information for patients about their expected progress and discharge from hospital.2. Providing special nutritional supplements for the patients prior to their admission to hospital.3.Tailoring fluid management guided by a LiDCO machine (a minimally invasive device that monitors cardiac functions).4. Early mobilisation and return to normal living as soon as possible after the completion of the operation.ERPs have been implemented for patients undergoing colorectal surgery and have improved patients experience, have sped up recovery and been more cost-effective than standard care. This study investigates whether an ERP can produce the same benefits in patients having liver operations. We will compare two groups of patients, one group having the current, excellent care which we provide, the other having an ERP. We will look at the following different elements and compare them between groups:1. The length of time patients have to remain in hospital following their operation2. The quality of life for patients in both groups  assessed by means of a questionnaire completed by patients both before and after the operation3.  The patientssatisfaction with their care  assessed by means of a questionnaire completed by the patients after they leave the hospital4.  The post-operative comfort level  assessed by making a daily review of the patientspain5. The incidence of post-operative complications e.g. chest infections6. The financial cost of each method7. The difference in stress response and immune system function (cell-mediated immunity) after surgery in the ERP group compared with the control groupWhat does the study involve?During this study, patients will have consented to blood being taken for stress response and cell-mediated immune function analysis on five occasions. The first blood sample will be taken from a cannula. The second and third blood samples will be taken from the patient's central line. The fourth and  fifth blood samples will be taken from a peripheral vein at the same time as the routine post-operative blood samples are being taken. In this way we will ensure that the blood sampling will entail no additional injections/needles thus minimising the inconvenience to patients.Participants who are allocated to the treatment group (ERP) will have the enhanced recovery information sheet/checklist, which they will be encouraged to complete on a daily basis before and after surgery (eight days in total).Although this is an additional task, it is key to the treatment as it both educates and empowers patients in their recovery after surgery.All trial participants will have to complete questionnaires (ten in total). To minimise inconvenience, these questionnaires are as short and simple as possible, and all participants will be shown how to fill them out. All questionnaires after discharge will have a stamped addressed envelope to make it easier for patients to return them by post. The contact details of members of the clinical research team will be given to all patients who can then contact them in the event of any concerns or questions regarding the study.Who can take part?All patients due to have an elective open liver resection at the Royal Surrey County Hospital are being invited to participate.Where is the study run from?Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? The trial is expected to run from early 2011 to early 2012. What are the risks to participants?Undergoing liver resection surgery presents risks. There will be no additional risks for patients who participate in the trial compared with those who do not. The risks from anaesthesia and surgery will be the same for both the treatment and the control group. All the aspects of the enhanced recovery program (including the peri-operative carbohydrate drinks, goal-directed fluid therapy, early mobilisation and early feeding) have been shown to be safe without increasing risk to the patient.Who is funding the project?The Research and Development Department of the Royal Surrey County Hospital, together with GUTS (Guildford Undetected Tumour Screening) and LCSA (Liver Cancer Surgery Appeal) charities, are funding the project.Who is the main contact?Dr Nial Quineynialquiney@nhs.net"

                "intervention": "Randomisation  patients will be randomised into the IG or CG. Randomisation will be carried out by an independent statistician in the Department of Mathematics, University of Surrey. Concealment will be achieved by the use of brown opaque envelopes containing group allocation for the next patient in the trial. Sample size  The sample size calculation has been based on the level of variation (mean = 9.213, SD = 4.946) of postoperative length of stay determined by a prospective audit of all patients undergoing liver resections at the hospital in the last 12 months. We consider that a clinically (and economically) significant reduction in hospital length of stay is 3 days; this is also what other surgical Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) have achieved. In order to determine (with a power of 80%, using a two-sided two-sample Students t-test), whether the IG group have a 3-day (or 30%) reduction in postoperative length of stay compared to CG, a minimum of 89 patients will be required (i.e. 45 patients in each group). Currently the unit undertakes around 100 liver resections/year. Assuming 30% do not wish to participate or do not meet eligibility criteria, we will need 15 months to meet our achieved sample size. We are assuming no drop out following recruitment, since all patients will have a hospital length of stay.Blinding  Group allocation will be un-blinded to the patient and the clinicians, but to reduce bias both groups will be treated using strict protocols. Two independent assessors (who will be blinded to group allocation) will assess whether the patient is ready to be discharged home (main outcome measure). The patient will only be discharged from hospital if both assessors agree to discharge. The outcome measure of Quality of Life (QoL) and pain will be completed by the patient following a reminder from the Clinical Nurse Specialist (blinded to group allocation). It will not be possible to blind the Research Fellow (RF), so the outcome measures of post-operative morbidity and surgical complications will not be blinded.The intervention group (Enhanced recovery and goal-directed therapy group)Interventions - the patient will receive a comprehensive patient checklist. Patient education is an important part of the ERP. The leaflet explains the daily goals the patient needs to achieve (in terms of nutrition and mobilisation). Although this is an additional burden it actually forms a key part of the treatment by both educating and empowering the patient in their recovery after surgery.1. Pre-operatively1.1. Nutritional supplements (Fortisip®- Nutricia) taken for three days prior to surgery (one bottle, three times/day). These supplements will be given to the patients at pre-assessment clinic by the research fellow (RF), following randomisation into the IG. They will be instructed how and when to take them by the RF and the patient checklist contains written prompts to help remind them.1.2. Night before surgery (21:00) the patients take 100g carbohydrate drink (preOp  Nutricia), and further 50 g 2 hours before surgery. The patients will have been supplied these carbohydrate drinks at the same time as they received the nutritional supplements.1.3. Pre-operatively 10 ml venous blood taken for stress response analysis.2. During surgery2.1. The anaesthetic management is standardised for both groups2.2. The surgical management and technique is the same for both groups, apart from a more rationalised approach to nasogastric tubes and surgical drain usage in IG i.e. rather than the routine placement of drains and nasogastric (NG) tubes, these will only be used if deemed clinically necessary by the surgical team2.3. To reduce bleeding, all patients are deliberately fluid restricted during theatre (standard practice). Once the resection is complete the patients in the IG will receive fluid therapy as per the goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) protocol with the LiDCO Rapid monitor3. Post-operatively (afternoon of day of surgery)3.1. In addition to routine blood tests, 10 ml venous blood taken for stress response analysis from central venous line in patients neck3.2. The patient will go as normal to a level 2 critical care bed, where the GDFT will continue for 6 hrs4. Day 1 post-operatively4.1. In addition to routine blood tests, 10 ml venous blood taken for stress response analysis from central venous line in patients neck4.2. Oral fluids and diet will be encouraged immediately4.3. Patients will continue the nutritional supplements (Fortisip®) three times/day. If tolerating this, intravenous (IV) fluids will be stopped4.4. Patients will be mobilised from bed to chair or marching on the spot by the physiotherapists (morning and afternoon), as their clinical condition allows4.5. Patients will be started on regular oral analgesia (evening)5. Day 2 post-operatively5.1. In addition to routine blood tests, 10 ml venous blood taken for stress response analysis from central venous line in patients neck5.2. 07:00, 3 mg diamorphine will be administered via the epidural (this is routine practice prior to epidural removal in our unit)5.3. 09:00, epidural and urinary catheter will be removed. Once the epidurals down, mobilisation will be encouraged in line with the daily goals5.4. Nutritional supplements will continue until patient is ready for discharge5.5. Patients will be reviewed twice/day by the researchers to check that daily goals have been met and assess daily pain scores6. Days 3 onwards post-operativelyAs the central line will have been removed by this point, the final 10 ml of venous blood required for stress response analysis will be obtained via venepuncture of a peripheral vein in the patients arm (at the same time as routine blood tests are being taken), performed by the anaesthetic clinical fellow on day 3. Patients will be assessed to ensure daily goals are met. From Day 4 onwards, two assessors blinded to patient group will individually assess whether discharge criteria have been met using a checklist of the following criteria: good pain control with oral analgesia, tolerance of solid food, independently mobile, normal or decreasing serum bilirubin and patient willing to be dischargedControl group (standard perioperative care) 1. Once randomised to the CG the patient will continue with normal pre-assessment. Starvation times will be as normal.2. On the morning of surgery, 10 ml venous blood taken for stress response analysis from newly inserted cannula in arm of patient (IV access is routinely required to administer anaesthesia)3. After surgery, the patient will be fluid resuscitated (standard practice), using central venous pressure, central venous oxygen saturations and lactate levels as surrogate markers of perfusion. Post-operatively all patients will be admitted to (minimum) Level 2 critical care4. In addition to the routine daily blood tests that the patients undergo, 10 ml of venous blood for stress response analysis will be sampled on four further occasions (immediately post-op and on the morning of days 1, 2 and 3 post-op) either from the central line in the patients neck, or peripheral venepuncture if this has been removed.5. The epidural will continue to be reviewed by the pain team and will be discontinued on their advice. This is usually on day 3 or 4 currently. The urinary catheter will be removed 12 hours later as is current practice. Oral intake of fluids and diet is permitted immediately post-operatively but no specific dietary goals are set. On day one post-op, patients are mobilised from bed to chair by the physiotherapists, as their clinical condition allows, but are only seen once a day. On successive days mobilisation will be allowed as usual but with no specific daily goals.In summary, both groups will have the same high-quality anaesthetic, surgery and post-operative care. The treatment group will have extra pre-operative education on what to expect during their operative course, pre-operative nutritional supplements, GDFT for 6 hours once the liver resection is completed, daily post-operative nutritional and mobilisation goals to lead to earlier oral intake and accelerated functional recovery",

It will also assess the efficacy of commonly used anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, selected from a list of acceptable regimens, to the new capecitabine-docetaxol combination. In addition the long term safety and efficacy of two years tamoxifen followed by five years of letrozole will be investigated. Node-negative women, will be offered those randomisations for which they are eligible. Eligibility will be determined depending on an individual's clinical and genomic risk assessments, the consequent decision to administer chemotherapy, and their eligibility for endocrine therapy. In addition, all ER positive patients are offered randomisation to: seven years letrozole or two years tamoxifen then five years letrozole in a ratio of 1:1.Patients randomised to chemotherapy are randomised to one of two treatment arms:Arm 1 anthracycline-based: Patients may receive one of the following regimens:1. FEC 100: fluorouracil 500 mg/m^2, epirubicin 100 mg/m^2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m^2, all intravenous (iv) every three weeks for six cycles  2.

If oral cyclophosphamide is not tolerated, it may be switched to iv doses of 370 mg/m^2 on days 1 and 8  3. FAC: cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m^2 on day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m^2 iv on day 1, fluorouracil 500 mg/m^2 iv on day 1, every three weeks for six cycles  4.

The patient will then be weighed. A Teflon® heparinised sampling catheter will be inserted in a forearm vein.Baseline blood samples will be taken as described below. Part of the blood sample will be taken at baseline for immediate culture (for an in-vitro susceptibility test) and also storage of parasites (cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen), parasite deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]. On admission 5 ml blood will be collected for parasite count (thin and thick films stained by Giemsa's method), and routine biochemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, total protein, glucose and total carbon dioxide) and haematology (haematocrit, haemoglobin, white blood cell count with differentiation, platelets). An additional 5 ml of blood will be collected in a sterile heparinised tube for parasite culture and cryopreservation, and 2 ml for assessment of drug levels (artesunate and mefloquine).The total amount of blood taken for study purposes will be 12 ml on admission and about 10 to 20 ml during follow-up (dependent on the parasite clearance time; blood collection for parasitaemia during hospitalisation will stop when the patient is parasite negative).Sampling (2 ml):1. Parasite counts: 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24 hours then 6 hourly until parasite clearance2. Drug levels: plasma samples will be taken. Most are fixed times but for artesunate there is a population PK component so random times within time-bins are proposed. In children capillary whole blood sampling for mefloquine may need to be substituted.Patients will remain in hospital for 7 days or longer if parasites have not cleared. They will then be followed up to Day 63 and at each weekly visit will have a haematocrit and parasite count checked.",

The standard intramuscular rabies post-exposure vaccine regimen will be compared with two current economical intradermal regimens and a new improved intradermal regimen.Unfortunately, recruitment was badly affected by a general anti vaccination sentiment in UK resulting from the media campaign against MMR. Our intention to recruit from the armed forces was thwarted by bad experiences with multiple vaccinations, in particular against anthrax, in preparation for the Iraq war. The funds for the trial ran out last year and while seeking an extension of the grant, recruitment was stopped temporarily. We have re-evaluated what can be achieved using internal funds and honorary staff, and have now restarted recruiting. The strategy has been changed to carry out a smaller study. The size is reduced by elimination of three of the seven study arms. The remaining groups will still provide data on the most important objectives, and may give results which could alter routine rabies post-exposure treatment.",

                "background_study_aims": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited disorder worldwide affecting 300,000 births annually.  Most cases are in sub-Saharan Africa where poor detection and care result in high childhood mortality, malnutrition, illness and disability in survivors. SCD is caused by abnormal haemoglobin, the compound in red blood cells (RBC) that carries oxygen. Damage to the blood vessels (known as vascular endothelial dysfunction) which results from the effects of the abnormal haemoglobin is thought to underlie many of the symptoms and disability in SCD.  In addition, reduced growth  is also common in children with SCD, probably from a combination of reduced dietary intake, increased demand and metabolic disturbance.The aims of this trial are to determine the effects of a Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) on growth in a non-screened population of African children with SCD and to determine whether an RUSF fortified with the naturally occurring amino acids L-arginine and L-citrulline, delivered with daily chloroquine (CQ), compared to the standard RUSF, can improve vascular endothelial function. ",
                "who_can_participate": " Participants in this trial are children with SCD who are enrolled in the Muhimbili Sickle Cohort, Dar es Salaam Tanzania, and who are aged 8-11 years at enrolment. ",
                "study_involves": "Children will receive two different formulations of RUSF,  in random order, each for 4 months, with a 4-month washout period after each intervention during which participants will not take any supplement.  The simple RUSF will be compared to a vascular RUSF, fortified with arginine and citrulline and delivered with daily chloroquine syrup. The simple RUSF will be delivered with a weekly dose of chloroquine syrup, as recommended for anti-malarial prophylaxis in this population group.",
                "benefits_risks": "There will be no direct or financial benefits to participation in this study. Participating will allow the investigators to find out if a food supplement and daily chloroquine compared to weekly is of significant benefit to patients with SCD. There is a very small risk of participants having an allergic reaction to the food supplements. We will minimize this risk by observing a small test amount of the supplement at the first home visit and delivery of the supplement. The volume of blood collected is small and only slightly more than is normally collected at the sickle clinics and will not affect the health of the participant. Some children may find the pressure cuff uncomfortable while it is inflated and there is a possible risk that the participant may experience some pain after its release, although we have never observed this to happen. As with any drug, there is a small risk that participants may experience some adverse effects associated with the use of chloroquine (weekly or daily doses). The majority of such effects are short-lived and non-serious, but we will be monitoring all these events and parents are asked to report any symptoms or concerns during the weekly clinic visits or to call the SCD patient hotline.

However, it is not known what changes in dopaminergic and serotonergic metabolism will be induced by quetiapine at central sites and in the periphery, whether these changes will be interrelated and whether these changes will be related to clinical response.Therefore, the effect of quetiapine on serotonine and dopamine in man will be measured in a study in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5-HIAA and HVA (metabolites of serotonine and dopamine) and of some neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y [NPY] and corticotropin releasing factor [CRF]) will be determined before (baseline) and after a 4 week administration (post-treatment) of quetiapine (600 mg/daily) in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Moreover, quetiapine will be measured in CSF and plasma to study the transport into the brain. Furthermore, we will assess whether the presumed change of CSF 5-HIAA, HVA and the improvement of clinical symptoms will be related to the receptor occupancy of quetiapine and to its pharmacokinetics in plasma and CSF.This study design allows us to correlate pre- to post-treatment changes in biochemical variables as well as with psychopathological response.",

Recruitment of the subjects is expected to take 12 months, therefore the total study will last approximately 13 months. The protocol will be submitted to the Ethics Committee of the LÄK in Frankfurt a.M., Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte in Bonn and the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz in Salzgitter, Germany. Written informed consent will be obtained from the patients after explanation of the purpose and design of the study.Subjects: Selection and assessmentTwenty two patients with a DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994) diagnosis of schizophrenia assessed by SCID, aged 18 - 55 years, will be recruited. All patients will be assessed before treatment (baseline) after a 3 day wash-out period and then at weekly intervals during treatment by an expert clinician using PANSS and CGI for severity of illness and for improvement with treatment. All patients will undergo an extensive physical and laboratory check up, including haematology, clinical chemistry, toxicological urine tests, electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) before inclusion into the study. Baseline - Collection (Metabolites, Neuropeptides) and PET imagingThe patients will be have to be free from drugs, which could possibly interfere with CNS amine metabolites for at least 3 days prior to the study. After a 3 day wash-out period (baseline), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be obtained by lumbar puncture (LP) at 9:50 a.m. After this procedure D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy will be measured at 10:00 a.m. using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. TreatmentAll 22 patients will be assigned to quetiapine (up to 600 mg/daily) treatment for 4 weeks distrubted over the day according individual tolerability. Patients receive per os, at breakfast, active treatment with quetiapine. The total daily dose for the first 4 days therapy is 50 mg (Day 1), 100 mg (Day 2), 200 mg (Day 3), 300 mg (Day 4) and 600 mg on week 1.Post-Treatment - Collection (Metabolites, Neuropeptides) and PET imagingDue to the measurement of D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy on day 28 the daily dose (600 mg) has to be administered at 8:00 a.m., plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be obtained at 9:50 a.m. After this procedure D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy will be measured at 10:00 a.m. using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.",

                "secondary_outcome_measure": "1. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics:Atypical antipsychotic drugs are generally biotransformed to metabolites that have a different pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile from that of the parent compound. Consequently, the hypothesis that metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties of a drug and its metabolites play an important role in their overall pharmacological activity is plausible and needs to be explored for quetiapine. Preliminary exploratory information will be obtained on:1.1. The relative concentrations of quetiapine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) versus plasma, and on the plasma/CSF ratio-clinical effectiveness relationship in patients with schizophrenia, taking into account the phenotype/genotype of MDR1-polymorphism. To date no published data are available on this issue.1.2. The role of the MDR1-polymorphism on the concentrations of quetiapine and 5-HIAA and HVA in CSF, and on the possible existence of a transport of quetiapine through the blood brain barrierThe hypothesis is that the relative concentrations of quetiapine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are approximately half of those in plasma, measured after 4-week quetiapine treatment. Moreover, quetiapine administration should result in a highly significantly correlation between quetiapine in plasma and quetiapine in CSF concentrations. 2. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides:Dysregulation of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems as well as altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are likely, but not necessary involved in pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, accumulated evidence indicates that NPY, as well as CRF, also play a role. Preliminary exploratory information will be obtained on:2.1. The relative concentrations of neuropeptides e.g. NPY and CRF measured at pre-treatment and after quetiapine medication period and the relationship with clinical improvement. To date no published data are available on this issue.The determinations of NPY and CRF in CSF, measured at baseline and after treatment will significant predict the degree of symptom improvement following 4 weeks quetiapine treatment (i.e. decrease in PANSS total score) and correlate with the availability of quetiapine in the central nervous system as shown by its CSF concentrations.3. Neuroimaging:The primary motive for seeking information on the occupancy of central nervous system (CNS) receptors by drugs is that the kinetics of a drug in brain may differ from its kinetics in plasma. The drug receptor complex may dissociate more slowly than the rate by which the concentrations of free drug is reduced in blood. It is also possible that the drug does not reach its target because of diffusion barriers or rapid peripheral metabolism. Kinetics of the drug at its target site can only be assessed by non-invasive imaging techniques like PET. Preliminary information will be obtained on:3.1. The relationship between D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy and CSF kinetics of quetiapine, biochemical parameters (5-HIAA and HVA) and clinical improvement. To date no published data are available on this issue.The determinations of D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy, measured at baseline and after treatment will significantly predict the degree of symptom improvement following 4 weeks quetiapine treatment (i.e. decrease in PANSS total score) and correlate with the availability of quetiapine in the central nervous system as shown by its CSF concentrations. Moreover, occupancy of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors correlate significantly with the changes in the CSF 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations.4. Clinical variables:For the evaluation of the clinical response of the patients under the neuroleptic treatment with quetiapine in exploratory way PANSS and CGI-ratings will be applied. In addition, PANSS-ratings will be related to the expected change in the primary variable to assess a probable relationship between the changes in 5-HIAA induced by quetiapine and the clinical state at the end of the treatment.",

The study design was chosen in order to have a 'head to head' comparison of this new combination  versus the best available therapy. Consultation was held with lead neurologists in other regional centres.  The reason for comparing this treatment combination to high-dose Interferon Beta (Rebif 44) is that in most UK centres interferon would be considered 'standard or best' management of active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. There was no consideration of  using a placebo as not to treat this patient group would lead to sustained disability in the long term (and would be unethical).  The risks to the patients are minimised by proper safety tests (including echocardiograms, blood and urine tests) both before and during treatment. Also, the patients will not be excessively inconvenienced as we have tailored visits to be similar to what occurs in normal NHS practice.  Timetable:- February 2005 - January 2006: Recruitment of Patients- January 2006 - January 2009: Follow-up of patients with ongoing data collection.  - February 2009 - June 2009: Analysis and Presentation/Publication of Data.  The interviews will take place at the Clinical Trials Unit at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery and similar units at the other participating regional trial centres.  There will be a planned interim analysis at 18 months of the study.  At the end of the study, the participants will receive a letter explaining the results found.  To prevent any 'researcher bias', each participating centre will have a treating physician and an examining physician. The treating physician will recruit and treat the patients whereas the examining physician will do all baseline and follow-up examinations. The examining physician would be unaware or 'blinded' as to which treatment the patient is receiving and thus eliminating bias.",

                "study_hypothesis": "Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains incurable and there has been little change in long term outcomes. Chemotherapy is used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. Nevertheless, most tumours inevitably progress and the clinical response rates to subsequent chemotherapy agents are disappointing. There is, therefore, a need for continued clinical research into new strategies to enhance the effectiveness of currently available chemotherapy agents to improve survival.The endothelin pathway has been implicated in a number of oncogenic pathways. ET-1 and ETAR are frequently over-expressed in breast cancers and are prognostic for poor outcome. Inhibition of the endothelin pathway enhances cytotoxicity when combined with chemotherapy agents such as carboplatin in pre-clinical models. ZD4054 is a specific inhibitor of ETAR and represents a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.This study investigates whether ZD4054, an oral endothelin A receptor (ETAR) inhibitor, in combination with carboplatin chemotherapy, has sufficient activity to warrant a future Phase III trial in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.",

If Dose Level 2 is NOT tolerable (i.e. ≥ 2 DLTs in 6 patients within the same dose level) then the study will not proceed to stage 2. 1.2.3. If a patient in Dose Level 2 experiences DLT then that patient may receive a de-escalated dose of carboplatin (AUC4) with ZD4054 on subsequent cycles. 2.

Patients were inhaled budesonide and formoterol from a Turbohaler (Pulmicort 200μg and Oxez 9μg respectively, AstraZeneca Liquid Production, Sweden)4. During the last 2 weeks of this period, single blind placebo OM-85 BV (saccharin) was added5. In the end of the run-in period patients were reassessed to establish their adherence to the current regimen and level of asthma control. Following, eligible patients were randomized in three strata: Stratum I (uncontrolled, NCA), stratum 2 (partly controlled asthma, PCA) and stratum 3 (controlled asthma, CA).  6. In NCA patients the dose of budesonide was stepped up to 4 times the dose used (up to 1600 μg/day)7. In PCA patients the dose of budesonide was increased by 50%, while in CA patients budesonide dosage was stepped down by 50%.  8. Following patients in each stratum were randomized according to a central computer generated schedule, to receive either 7mg of OM-85 BV (Bronho-Vaxom; OM PHARMA;Geneva;Switzerland)) or matching placebo saccharin once daily, orally, fasting in the morning9. Treatment assignments (1:1) were stratified in every stratum according 3 budesonide dose levels (200-400, 400-800 and 800-1600 mcg/day)10. In the absence of exacerbations and/or adverse events, patients were reassessed every 12 weeks and the dose of budesonide was titrated each time, as prescribed above. 11. During the study, use of theophylline, leukotriene modifiers and extra formoterol was not permitted12.

                "study_hypothesis": "Only 10 - 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer can be resected with curative intent at the time of diagnosis. Unfortunately, loco-regional recurrence and/or metastatic disease develop in the majority of patients who undergo pancreatic resection. Most patients typically relapse within 9 - 15 months from initial presentation and have median life expectancies of only 12 - 15 months without adjuvant therapy. The 5-year survival of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma is approximately 10% for patients without adjuvant therapy.In this clinical trial a de-escalation of CapRI-regime (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, interferon alpha-2b [INTRON A®] and external beam radiation) is investigated. We hypothesise that removal of cisplatin and radiotherapy will have no significant effect or only a minor impact on the clinical response but result in lower toxicity.Please note that this is a follow-up study to a previously registered trial (see ISRCTN62866759 - http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN62866759).Please also note that as of 02/10/2008 the initial inclusion and exclusion criteria of this trial were updated with the approval of the national competent authority. All changes to this trial record can be found in the relevant field under the above update date. Please also note that this update resulted in a change of the anticipated start and end dates of this trial. The initial anticipated start and end dates were as following:Initial anticipated start date: 01/01/2009Initial anticipated end date: 01/03/2012",

Arm C: 5-fluorouracil and INTRON A® (CapRI ultra light)In all arms, patients will be treated for 23 weeks. All patients will be treated with 5-fluorouracil and INTRON A®. Patients randomised to arms A or B will additionally receive external beam radiation; patients in arm A receive additional cisplatin.Dosage, frequency:1. First cycle of 5-FU: 200 mg/m^2/day by continuous intravenous infusion days 1 - 382. Second and third cycle 5-FU: 200/mg/m^2/day by continuous intravenous infusion days 64 - 101 and 120 - 1613. Interferon alpha-2b: 3 million units subcutaneously on Monday, Wednesday and Friday (SQ MWF) days 1 - 38 (17 total doses) plus one injection prior to treatment start given during week -1 (approx. day -6) 4. Cisplatin (arm A): 30 mg/m^2 (capped at body surface area [BSA] = 2 m^2; maximum single cisplatin dose of 60 mg) intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 (6 doses). Two to three hours before and after cisplatin dose the patients will receive hydration of at least 2 litres. Patients will be taught to drink at least 1 litre during the day.5. Radiotherapy (arm A and B): the pancreatic bed will be covered with a minimum margin of 2 cm. The porta hepatis, origins of the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery will be included. The anteroposterior/posteroanterior (AP/PA) fields must include the entire duodenal C-loop as seen on pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scan. Total dose will be 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks (1.8 Gy/day). The dose contribution from the lateral fields should be restricted to 20 Gy. Total duration of follow-up for all treatment arms:The duration of the trial for each patient is expected to be 6 months. The duration of the overall trial is expected to be approximately 3 years. Recruitment of patients will start in I/2009. The actual overall duration or recruitment may vary. Patients will be tracked by quarterly phone follow-up for recurrence and/or death.",

                "intervention": "Combination therapy started with sulphasalazine 500 mg twice daily, methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly, and hydroxichloroquine 300 mg daily, and prednisolone 5 mg daily. This initial combination, if tolerated, was continued for 3 months. If the clinical improvement at 3 months was under 50% in at least two of the three criteria (swollen joints, tender joints, and ESR or CRP), the respective doses of methotrexate and prednisolone were increased to 10 mg weekly and 7.5 mg daily. The protocol allowed flexible subsequent dose adjustment to mimic clinical practice. Thus, the highest dose at 9 months and thereafter was 2 g daily for sulphasalazine, 15 mg weekly for methotrexate, 300 mg daily for hydroxychloroquine, and 10 mg daily for prednisolone. If a patient reached remission during the first year with initial combination, the drug doses were tapered, and prednisolone and methotrexate could even be discontinued at 9 months and 18 months, respectively. Sulphasalazine (1 g daily), and hydroxychloroquine (300 mg daily) had to be continued for 2 years. In the patients who reached remission during the first year, but not with the initial combination, the drug doses were gradually tapered to those of the second year. If the induced remission was lost, the DMARD doses were increased with the intention of reaching remission. If one or several components of the combination had to be discontinued for any reason, a combination of three DMARDs was restarted by replacing sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine with auranofin (3 - 6 mg daily), and methotrexate with azathioprine (2 mg/kg daily). Other DMARDs could also be used as substitutes.The single-treatment strategy was also targeted to achieve remission. The simultaneous use of oral prednisolone up to 10 mg was allowed in patients with continuously active disease, but simultaneous use of multiple DMARDs was not allowed. The decision to use prednisolone was made by the treating physician. The patients were treated continuously with one DMARD alone, with or without prednisolone. If a more beneficial effect was needed, the dose was increased or the DMARD was changed. Sulphasalazine (2 g daily) was used as the initial drug in all patients, and the dose was increase to 3 g daily at 3 months, if clinically indicated. If an adverse event occurred, or if the clinical response was less than 25% at 6 months, the protocol required that sulphasalazine was replaced with methotrexate 87.5 mg - 15 mg weekly).Intraarticular injections of glucocorticoids into inflamed joints were allowed in both treatment arms. All the patients were clinically assessed at baseline and at months 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 24 and the adjusments of drug doses were performed. After two years, treatment was still aimed at achieving or maintaining remissions, but the choise and use of DMARDs was unrestricted. Thus, regardless of the original randomisation group, patients who had an insufficient response could be treated liberally with increased dosages of DMARDs (methotrexate up to 25 mg/week) and with DMARD combination when clinically indicated and tolerated.",

The primary ingredient was mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana L.) whole fruit puree. Other ingredients were apple fruit juice, pear fruit juice, grape fruit juice, pear fruit puree, blueberry fruit juice, raspberry fruit juice, strawberry fruit juice, cranberry fruit juice, and cherry fruit juice. The placebo consisted of water, sucrose (3 g/30 ml), citric acid, red grape juice concentrate, fibre complex, grape skin, natural flavours, red #40, cloud (ester gum), whey protein isolate, sodium benzoate, xanthan gum, blue #1, and caramel color. Three different dosages of the juice were tested and compared to placebo. The product doses tested were 3 oz, 6 oz and 9 oz. All doses and placebo were consumed in a total of 9 oz of liquid in identical bottles. The placebo was used to make up the volume for the lower doses. Subjects were instructed to consume the assigned drink twice a day, once in the morning and again in the evening.

                "study_hypothesis": "The hypothesis is that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In order to start immune reactions in the CNS, myelin antigen needs to be presented on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in conjunction with MHC class II molecules, and this antigen-MHC II complex needs to be recognised by a specific T cell receptor (TCR) of the anti-myelin T cells. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine inhibits interferon gamma-induced MHC class II antigen expression on astrocytes in vitro through ß2 adrenergic signal transduction mechanisms. We found that astrocytes in MS lack ß2 adrenergic receptors. We hypothesise that a loss of these receptors in MS facilitate the deviation of astrocytes to function as facultative immunocompetent antigen presenting cells. In support of this, we were able to demonstrate that reactive astrocytes in MS lesions express MHC class II and B7-costimulatory molecules, and are therefore equipped to promote APC-dependent T cell activation. Compounds that elevate cAMP in astrocytes may restore suppression of MHC class II molecules in astrocytes. We  investigated other aminergic receptors on astrocytes in MS and found some receptors that are also linked to the regulation of intracellular cAMP formation. An interesting candidate receptor is the 5-HT4 receptor. We intended to start a clinical study in patients in MS with the 5-HT4 agonist cisapride. However, we abandoned this project because of recent serious safety concerns with cisapride.Astrocytes also contain the 5-HT transporter. Drugs that block this transporter elevate endogenous serotonin concentrations, and it has been shown that serotonin also increases cAMP levels in cultured astrocytes. Fluoxetine is a prototype drug that can be used to achieve this goal. Fluoxetine is occasionally used in patients with MS who are depressed. One investigator (Traugott) noticed that patients using fluoxetine seemed to stabilize with respect to their MS-related symptoms. She also found a beneficial effect of fluoxetine in an animal model of MS, chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalitis. The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the effects of fluoxetine, a 5-HT transporter blocker, on disease activity in patients with MS. The drug is well tolerated and is off patent.",

                "study_hypothesis": "Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is the approved standard therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The effect of IFN-beta in relapsing-remitting MS is primarily directed against the Th1-driven inflammatory demyelinating attack. IFN-beta may interfere with cell trafficking by decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules and inhibit matrix metalloproteinases; reduce the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules on antigen presenting cells; inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of IFN-beta on clinical disease activity is only moderate and many patients have only a partial treatment response.The possible beneficial effect of intravenous methylprednisolone in delaying the onset of MS after optic neuritis has been suggested to be due to its anti-inflammatory and/or immune regulatory activity. Since IFN-beta also has such biological and immunological properties it seems justified to investigate the potential effect of the combination of methylprednisolone and IFN-beta in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Further methylprednisolone might have a positive effect on the occurrence of side effects to IFN-beta treatment and might reduce the occurrence of neutralising antibodies against IFN-beta. Adjuvant intermittent treatment with methylprednisolone is easy to administer, well tolerated and relatively inexpensive. The objective of the study is to compare the effect of methylprednisolone given at 4-week intervals with the effect of placebo in patients treated with IFN-beta-1a who during therapy have shown clinical activity.",

                "study_hypothesis": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been proved as one principal inducer of hepatiocellular carcinoma (HCC) by epidemiology study and animal experiment. And for many unresectable HCC, transcatheter arterial chemoembolism (TACE) is the most effective way to relieve the disease and elongate life. However, some studies have revealed that TACE may reactivate HBV replication and result in worse prognosis in HCC patients. Some evidences show that interferon-alpha (IFN-a) can reduce HBV level effectively and safely. In addition, IFN-a has also been proved a worthful therapy to HBV-related HCC with postponed recurrence and prolonged life time. We assume that at the same time of TACE treatment, administration of IFN-a may suppress the reactivation of HBV replication. To test our assumption, we designed a randomised controlled study in HCC patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBS-Ag) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBe-Ag) to evaluate the efficacy of HBV inhibition and survival by double therapy with TACE and IFN-a versus monotherapy with TACE.",

Malaria is responsible for 40-60% of out patient consultation. It presents in two clinical types - uncomplicated and severe malaria. Study Domain: Parasitic infection; child care and health education/behaviour changeStudy hypotheses:  1. There will be no significant difference in the outcome of malaria in children whose mothers or caregivers used treatment protocol to treat malaria at home and those whose mothers did not use the protocol. 2. There will be no significant difference in the correctness of use of chloroquine by mothers who used the treatment protocol and those who did not use the protocol. 3.

Training of 'mother trainers' and community members about cause, symptoms and signs of the clinical types, treatment and prevention of malaria including referral. 2. Development of a treatment protocol using participatory approach and distribution of the protocol to households. The development of the protocol was done in phases using modified focus group sessions with several community checks at different stages of development. The participants were the 'mother trainers', selected community members, research team and a graphic artist. The treatment protocol consists of treatment guidelines for each of the clinical types of malaria compiled together on a cardboard. The protocol illustrated the presentation of clinical types of malaria, the appropriate steps to take for each type and the correct dose and schedule of treatment of uncomplicated malaria using chloroquine according to the age of the child. The protocol was in cartoon format and the local language was used. Mothers/caregivers in both arms of the study were requested to purchase the chloroquine used for treatment from their regular source which in most instances are the drug hawkers and patent medicine sellers. Control arm of the study: They were passive controls. The communities in the control arm of the study were left to continue their usual treatment practice for malaria in their children.

Especially when under the treatment condition of testosterone with sildenafil. In addition, we will investigate the effects of testosterone in combination with sildenafil on vaginal and subjective sexual arousal induced by visual erotic stimuli in females with Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) and control subjects, for individual motivational and emotional differences (valence). In earlier study's we've found a distinction between groups that differ in colour naming of erotic words compared to neutral words. These two groups also differed in their benefit from testosterone combined with sildenafil. We expect that for some women this treatment, testosterone with sildenafil will work adequately. For the other group, we expect that negative sexual experiences and personality differences and therefore the negative/defensive motivational neural circuit is responsible for the more diffuse reaction to the treatment of testosterone and sildenafil, in women with FSD.",

Two different drug combinations will be given on separate days: (day 1) placebo, (day 2) sildenafil plus testosterone. Drug administration will be divided into two parts. Testosterone will be administered first. Two hours after testosterone administration, sildenafil (Viagra) will be administered. Testosterone will have a behavioural effect, increasing sexual desire and arousal, after four hours of intake. Sildenafil will have a physical effect, increasing blood flow to the genitals, after 1 hour of intake.

Evaluation of the women's judgment of valence (negative or positive) for erotic stimuli under placebo condition and the condition of 0.5 mg sublingual testosterone combined with sildenafil (50 mg) and the influence of positive and/or negative valence on attention for erotic cues, in healthy female subjects with and without Female Sexual Dysfunction. Data for analysis:1. Attention for erotic stimuli (strooptask: speedrate). A masked version of the Emotional Stroop Task comparing colour-naming latencies on neutral and erotic words will be used. The word is presented before and after the erotic film excerpts in the attention condition for about 24 ms and then masked by randomly cut, reassembled signs in the same colour (red, green, yellow or blue). The colour of the mask has to be assigned, and subjects are asked to verbally name the colours as quickly as possible. The stimuli are presented in the centre of the screen. An extra set of stimuli will be prepared for practice-trials. A trial consists of a fixation point, which will be shown for 750 ms, followed by the target stimulus (the coloured neutral or erotic word and mask). Vocal responses will be recorded and will terminate the trials. The order of these 2 blocks will be randomly assigned. Attention will be measured on both the experimental days in the morning (pre-dose) and in the afternoon (post-dose).2. Vaginal Pulse Amplitude (VPA. A vaginal photoplethysmograph will be used to measure Vaginal Pulse Amplitude (VPA) (the AC component of the signal), which is a reliable index for genital vasocongestion. Changes in the amplitude of the signal reflect changes in vaginal vasocongestion. The Vaginal Photoplethysmograph (VP) is a clean tampon shaped device, which contains an infrared Light-Emitting Diode (LED) as a light source and a photosensitive light detector (photodiode). It measures the blood volume in the tissue surrounding the plethysmograph. The light emitted by the LED is reflected by the blood vessels in the tissue. This light is measured by the photodiode. The output signal of the photodiode varies with changes in the amount of blood in the vessels. VPA will be measured on both the experimental days in the morning (pre-dose) and in the afternoon (post-dose)3. Valence for erotic stimuli. Perceived emotional valence of erotic stimuli will be measured and compared to neutral, pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. Facial expressions reveal emotions with corresponding appetitive and defensive motivational circuits. The amygdala projects to the facial motor nucleus, which reflects the chosen motivational circuit; appetitive or defensive. Therefore, Electromyographic (EMG) activity will be measured over the corrugator, zygomatic major and orbicularis oculi muscles. Activation of the zygomatic muscle reveals a smile, but co-activation of the zygomatic and orbicularis mirrors a major smile. Activation of the corrugator muscle alone is correlated with viewing unpleasant events. More specifically, co-activation of the corrugator and orbicularis oculi reflects the emotion of repulsion and aversion. While viewing International Affective Picture System (IAPS) pictures (eight pictures for each domain; pleasant, neutral, unpleasant and erotic) and an additional category of sexually explicit pictures (depicting vaginal coitus), activation of the three muscles will be measured two seconds before picture onset and for six seconds during picture presentation. The activation of the orbicularis oculi muscle is also a component of the startle reflex. When viewing the pictures, half of all pictures will be accompanied by a startle stimulus. The acoustic startle stimulus consists of a 50-ms burst of white noise, presented at 95 dB. The startle stimuli will be presented through earplugs, between 3 and 5 seconds following picture onset. Prior to the first block, six startle sounds will be presented to allow habituation of the startle reflex. After the presentation of the pictures subjects are instructed to give a subjective rating of the emotional pictures by finger pointing at a touch screen. Each emotional picture will be followed by a picture of five figures with expressions ranging from happy (smiling) to unhappy (frowning). Subjects are instructed to rate on a 9-point scale how their feeling towards the preceding picture was reflected by one of the figures. The same was done for arousal, with excited, wide-eyed figures to sleepy, relaxed figures. Valence be measured on both the experimental days in the morning (pre-dose) and in the afternoon (post-dose).",

The target population is residents of three catchment areas within Bobo-Dioulasso, with care at dispensaries at Sarfalao, Colsama and Ouezzin-ville. The available population is residents aged 6 months and older who present to one of the study clinics with symptoms suggestive of malaria and who have a positive screening thick blood smear. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and are enrolled in the trial will be randomized to treatment with one of the three study regimens and will be followed for 42 days. The study regimens will be AL (Coartem), DP (Duocotexcin), and AQ/SP, each administered for three days. Repeat evaluations will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21,28, 35 and 42 and will include assessment for the occurrence of any serious adverse events. Treatment efficacy outcomes will be assessed using modifications of WHO clinical and parasitological classification criteria.Patients will be randomized to receive: 1. Artemether-lumefantrine (Novartis, 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine tablets, 1 [5 - 14 kg], 2 [15 - 24 kg], 3 [25 - 34 kg], or 4 [> 35 kg] tablets twice daily for 3 days) or 2.

It can produce a wide range of disease: Disseminated MAC disease (DMAC) in immunocompromised individuals and MAC Pulmonary Disease (MAC-PD) in immunocompetent adults. MAC disease is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although DMAC rates declined dramatically after 1995 with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, pulmonary physicians observed an increase in MAC-PD among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-negative patients in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The optimal treatment regimen for MAC-PD has not been fully established. The most clinically efficacious drugs for the treatment of MAC are the new macrolide or azalide antibiotics, clarithromycin or azithromycin, respectively. These drugs are generally part of a multidrug regimen that includes rifamycin and ethambutol. This regimen becomes expensive, is poorly tolerated, and can lead to a variety of side effects. Interferon gamma can enhance the hosts defense mechanism and thus contribute to disease clearance.Hypothesis:Adjuvant interferon gamma will increase overall response rate to treatment from 30% in the placebo group to 90%.",

If the haemoglobin drops by less than or equal to 12 g/d in men or less than or equal to 11 g/d in women, the blood letting treatment will be stopped without reaching the target ferritin. No further treatment will then be planned for these patients within the framework of this clinical trial. Patients who reach a target ferritin level of more than or equal to 50 to less than or equal to 100 µg/l will then receive further to the blood letting a combination treatment of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 48 weeks.The primary aim of this study will be a determination of the virus kinetics in the first 12 weeks of the peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin combination treatment in patients who have received the blood letting treatment compared with patients who have not received the blood letting treatment. Secondary aims will include the efficacy of the added treatment, the improvement of serum fibrosis markers, early and normal virological response and the safety and compatibility of blood letting treatment with the peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin standard treatment.",
