            "Brief Summary": "In December 2019, the Municipal Health Committee of Wuhan, China, identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by that virus, COVID-19. Recent numbers show that 222,643 infections have been diagnosed with 9115 deaths, worldwide. This has been escalating fast. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. In this scenario, the situation of a global public health emergency and evidence about the potential positive effect of chloroquine (CQ) in most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and recent data on small trials on SARS-CoV-2, the investigators intend to investigate the efficacy and the safety of CQ diphosphate in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the scenario of SARS-CoV2. Preliminary in vitro studies and uncontrolled trials with low number of patients of CQ repositioning in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging. The main hypothesis is that CQ diphosphate will reduce mortality in 50% in those with severe acute respiratory syndrome infected by the SARS-COV2. Therefore, the main objective is to assess whether the use of chloroquine diphosphate reduces mortality by 50% in the study population. The primary outcome is mortality in day 28 of follow-up. According to local contingency plan, developed by local government for COVID-19 in the State of Amazonas, the Hospital Pronto-Socorro Delphina Aziz, located in the northern region of Manaus, is the reference unit for the admission of serious cases of the new virus. The unit currently has 50 ICU beds, with the possibility of expanding to 335 beds, if needed. The hospital also has trained multiprofessional human resources and adequate infrastructure. The treatment regimen of chloroquine group consists of 600 mg bid (4 tablets of 150 mg, every 12 hours), orally (or via nasogastric tube in case of orotracheal intubation - IOT) for 10 days; placebo group will receive similar pills with no active ingredient in the same regimen, both produced by Farmanguinhos. Clinical and laboratory data during hospitalization will be used to assess efficacy and safety outcomes.",

            "Detailed Description": "In the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, that arose in Wuhan China, there is still sparse data in the course, risk of various complications, and in particular how patients who are hospitalized are best treated to ensure high survival and short hospitalization. Despite the rapid spread of the disease globally, there is no solid data yet to recommend any specific treatments, which is why symptomatic, organ supportive therapy including respiratory therapy in acute pulmonary failure is recommended. There has been reported a high incidence of bacterial super-infections in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 also have a higher risk of dying because of septic shock. Thus, there is an urgent need for treatment that can improve the patient's chance of the shortest hospitalization possible, and treatment that can lower the risk of secondary infection and death.\nThis is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multi-center trial evaluating the effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the treatment can shorten hospitalization, reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, admittance to Intensive Care Units and death.",
