            "summary": "In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay.\nWhilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations.\nThe clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV illness appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, case-fatality risk of 11-14% has been reported in several initial studies of seriously ill patients and case-fatality has been estimated approximately at 2% overall. Also the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and sometimes more advance ventilator support.\nThis new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation.\nGiven no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the ready availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent, based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.",

Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics.\nThis new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations.\nGiven no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.",

This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe. In 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus. Groups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus.There are currently no available vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. Although there have been some suggestions for untested treatments that could be added to the usual care in hospitals, none is known to help. The World Health Organization (WHO) is, therefore, organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other, to discover whether any do help. The study treatments are remdesivir, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir, and interferon-beta. Some are given as daily pills, and some as daily injections.",
                "who_can_participate": "Adults (aged over 18 years) hospitalized with definite COVID-19 and not already receiving any of the study drugs. Patients invited to join the study will be those who are admitted to a collaborating hospital. It is not possible for people to volunteer themselves or their relatives to participate.",
                "study_involves": "Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and who have consented to be part of the study will be randomly allocated to receive either local standard care alone or local standard care and one of a list of study drugs. During the study, some treatments may get removed from this list, and others may be added to it. Each patient will only receive one of the treatments.The patients will be followed up for the entire length of their hospital stay. Death from any cause will be recorded and this will be the main result used to determine whether a drug is effective. Length of hospital stay and time to first receiving ventilation (or intensive care) will also be recorded and used to determine the drug's effectiveness.",
                "benefits_risks": "All of the drugs tested in this study have been shown to be reasonably safe. Other than remdesivir the study drugs are used routinely to treat other conditions. All participants will receive the usual care for people with COVID-19 in each location as well as the study drug. There are known side effects to each of the study medications. It is possible that unexpected serious side effects may occur as with any clinical trial of medicines. It is also possible that treatment with one or more of the test drugs worsens COVID-19 and increases the risk of severe illness or death.It is possible that one or more of the drugs may reduce the severity of COVID-19, reduce need for ventilation, and reduce the risk of death.",
