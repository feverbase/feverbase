    <p>
        We're an international group of researchers collecting data, in real time, about what's worked, and what hasn't
        worked, to fight COVID-19. We're interested in the potential for repurposed drugs (e.g. chloroquine,
        hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir) to reduce or eliminate COVID-19 symptoms. Clinics across the world are
        beginning to use these drugs but sample sizes remain too small to draw conclusions about what works, and what
        doesn't. By pooling together data from <strong>all</strong> sites at Feverbase, we can accumulate knowledge and
        provide well-sourced information reviewed by teams of scientists.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>We need your help collecting and understanding data about how we fight COVID-19.</strong> We keep all
        submitted data fully secure and private and will collate the information into best practices for clinicians and
        resource-allocators to fight this pandemic.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>
    <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:private@feverbase.org">private@feverbase.org</a> with patient outcome
        information from your site. We're looking for patient information (such as age, sex, and comorbidities) and
        treatment information (drug, dose, timing) matched with the clinical outcome (e.g. quantitatively measured
        changes in symptom severity, duration, survival). We appreciate &mdash; and badly need &mdash; negative as well
        as positive results, since resources spent on things that don’t work can detract from other efforts. We may
        follow up with questions of clarification or to keep you posted about new developments. Time is of the essence!
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, if you have information about drug production capacity, data collection processes, or other clinical
        trials, we’d love to make a map of such efforts, and improve our recommendations for what additional kinds of
        data are needed.</p>

    <p><strong>What will we do with the data?</strong></p>
    <p>We will create an anonymized and pooled dataset from your contributions, which we will analyze to make public
        recommendations about which drugs seem to work best in treating COVID-19. We want to answer two questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What treatments should clinicians use to prevent or treat COVID-19?
        </li>
        <li>
            What drug manufacturing does society need to invest in to best beat COVID-19?
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        All parts of our analysis are going to be public, so everyone can benefit. If you would like to help analyze the
        data, please reach out. We will be releasing results periodically after analysis and a quality review of the
        data.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Will you share the data or use it to publish papers?</strong></p>
    <p>We will produce frequent blog posts about what seems to be working based on the data we collect. We will not be
        publishing this work in academic journals, nor disclosing your identity or affiliation.</p>
